Syafruddin, also known as Udin, was admitted to the intensive care unit of a Catholic hospital in Yogyakarta but never regained consciousness. He died in the hospital three days after the attack.

However, according to press reports, Syafruddin's widow claimed that the suspect, Dwi Sumadji, was not one of the men she saw kill her husband. She says he is a foil to deflect blame from the guilty parties.<br /> <br /> In December, the Indonesian Journalist Association (PWI) told reporters that Syafruddin was beaten to death because of his stories about corruption, and not by a jealous husband as policed alleged shortly after the attack. PWI chairman Sofyan Lubis said that evidence and testimony at the trial of the alleged killer confirmed the association's findings. The court concluded that there was insufficient evidence against Sumadji, and prosecutors dropped the charges against him.

CPJ wrote President Compaore urging that he launch a thorough and impartial investigation into Zongo's death and that he bring the perpetrators to justice.<br />
 In early August 2000, three members of President Blaise Compaore's Guard Regiment (RSP) went on trial for the murder of chauffeur David Ouedraogo. The three guards were found guilty of killing David Ouedraogo and sentenced to between 10 and 20 years in jail. The court also awarded the victim's family 200 million francs (US$227,000) in damages.

On November 28, 1998, he embarked on a 10-day trip to report on the Huichol Indians, an indigenous population that lives in a mountainous area stretching across Nayarit, Jalisco, and Durango states.<br />
 <br />
 The journalist was last seen alive on December 4 in the village of Salmotita. On December 16, after an intensive search by the Mexican military, True's body was found in a shallow grave partially covered with rocks at the bottom of a ravine. Neither his wedding ring nor his watch had been taken, suggesting that robbery was not a motive.<br />
 <br />
 On December 26, 1998, authorities arrested Juan Chivarra de la Cruz and his brother-in-law Miguel Hern·ndez de la Cruz, both Huichol Indians, and charged them with True's murder. Under questioning, Chivarra and Hernández confessed to murdering True because he had taken photographs without their permission. The journalist's belongings, including his camera, binoculars, and backpack, were found at the suspects' homes.<br />
 <br />
 When the two men were brought into court, however, they acknowledged killing True but claimed they had acted in self-defense. They also claimed that their confession had been extracted under torture. Jalisco State Attorney General Gerardo Octavio Solís Gómez has repeatedly denied these claims.<br />
 <br />
 Additional evidence points to the suspects' culpability. In 1999, a <em>Newsweek</em> reporter found a notebook belonging to True in a warehouse where case evidence was stored. In one entry, True described an encounter with a Huichol man named Juan, possibly a reference to Chivarra.<br />
 <br />
 Both suspects have repeatedly given contradictory statements in interviews with the <em>San Antonio Express-News</em>. While they initially contended that they had never seen True, they later admitted to meeting him. Then in an interview published on August 8, 2001, both men claimed they had seen the journalist but never talked to him.<br />
 <br />
 Mexican authorities have issued three separate forensic reports since True's body was found. The first, based on an autopsy by Jalisco State medical examiners, found that True had been strangled with his own bandana and sustained a head injury that was not attributable to a fall.<br />
 <br />
 The second report, based on an autopsy by the Federal Attorney General's Office, concluded that True died from blows to his head and body and from edema (accumulation of fluid in the lungs), most likely after suffering an accidental fall caused by heavy drinking. Both autopsies found a high concentration of alcohol in True's blood, a finding consistent with advanced decomposition, according to forensic experts consulted by the <em>Express-News</em>.<br />
 <br />
 It remains unclear why federal authorities ordered a second autopsy. True's already decomposed body was essentially dismembered during the first autopsy, making the possibility of drawing accurate conclusions from a second autopsy difficult at best.<br />
 <br />
 In March 2000, the third forensic report, which is required under Mexican law when two autopsies yield different results, found that True's death was caused by a pulmonary edema resulting from a head injury. This conclusion was based solely on the examiner's analysis of the first two autopsy reports.<br />
 <br />
 On August 3, 2001, Mexican Judge José Luis Reyes Contreras acquitted Chivarra and Hernández and ordered their release. On August 7, Jalisco Attorney General Solís Gómez said there was enough evidence to convict the two men and added that he would appeal the verdict.<br />
 <br />
 Judge Reyes Contreras has been quoted as saying that his decision to release the men was based on the second autopsy report, which concluded that True's death was accidental. The judge's ruling did not account for the fact that True's belongings were found in the two suspects' homes or that his body was hidden in a grave near the death site.<br />
 <br />
 The Jalisco State Attorney General's Office appealed the acquittals in a September 25, 2001, hearing before a panel of three magistrates from the State Supreme Court of Justice. On May 30, 2002, a three-judge appeals panel sentenced Chivarra and Hernández to 13-year prison terms for True's murder. The unanimous ruling overturned an August 2001 verdict that had acquitted the two men.<br />
 <br />
 In February 2003, a federal court overturned the 13-year sentences on procedural grounds. In November 2003, both the private investigator who worked to win the release of the men and the U.S. citizen who funded portions of their defense said Chivarra and Hernández had privately confessed to killing True and should be brought to justice.<br />
 <br />

At 6 a.m., as Garzón was driving his Jeep Cherokee to the Radionet studio, two men on a white motorcycle intercepted him, shooting him repeatedly in the head and chest.<p></p>

<p>Before his death, Garzón had frequently been threatened by Carlos Castaño, leader of the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), a right-wing paramilitary organization that is fighting against leftist guerrillas. Garzón's colleagues informed CPJ that the journalist had scheduled a meeting with Castaño for August 14, the day after he was killed. The AUC denied responsibility for Garzón's death, and it remains unclear who ordered the murder. While some local journalists blame the AUC, others blame drug traffickers or the military. The likely motive would have been Garzón's contacts with left-wing guerrilla forces.</p>

<p>Before launching his career as a journalist and satirist 10 years ago, Garzón served as an elected official in Sumapaz, a region near Bogotá that is dominated by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), Colombia's largest leftist guerrilla movement. More recently, Garzón used his stature as a well-respected broadcaster to negotiate for the release of victims of guerrilla kidnappings. He also served on an independent commission that was mediating between the government and the National Liberation Army (ELN), another leftist guerrilla movement, and was scheduled to meet with imprisoned ELN members.</p>

<p>The gunman who shot Garzón allegedly belonged to a criminal band known as La Terraza. Castaño admits he has hired La Terraza to carry out a number of crimes in recent years, including kidnappings. The official government charge sheet accuses him of hiring La Terraza to kill Garzón. In mid-2000, Castaño was officially charged with the murder.</p>

He was relaxing with two colleagues from the newspaper when a single assassin entered the hotel and shot the journalist four times before escaping on a motorcycle driven by an accomplice.<p></p>

<p>Quintero co-founded the Journalists' Club of Valledupar. He was also the local correspondent for ""Televista,"" a news program on the regional channel Telecaribe, and a professor at the National Correspondence University.</p>

<p>On September 29, police arrested two suspects, Jorge Espinal Velásquez and Rodolfo Nelson Rosado Martínez. According to local authorities, both men were identified by witnesses and are believed to be professional assassins.</p>

<p>Many local sources believe Quintero was killed in retaliation for his work as a journalist. They have suggested several possible motives. Quintero had recently been looking into the 1998 murder of Valledupar television journalist Amparo Leonor Jiménez Pallares. According to the attorney general's office, Jiménez was killed in retaliation for a story she broadcast in 1996 about the murder of peasants by a right-wing paramilitary death squad.&nbsp;</p><p>Quintero's assassination may also have been prompted by his public denunciation, in July, of an attack on the home of Saída Maestre, a presumed guerrilla sympathizer, in the town of Patillal. Quintero published the article after speaking with Maestre, who was then kidnapped on July 5. Her horribly mutilated body was found sometime later. The right-wing United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) was linked to Maestre's murder, and many have speculated that Quintero may have signed his own death sentence by publicly denouncing the attack.</p>

<p>Thoenes was shot dead on the evening of September 21, when his motorcycle taxi attempted to escape a group of armed men blocking the road, according to investigators with the U.N. civilian police force in East Timor. Eyewitnesses, including Thoenes's Timorese driver, Florindo da Conceicao Araujo, told investigators that six gunmen wearing Indonesian army uniforms shot at the motorcycle, causing it to crash. Araujo said he fled when he saw that the gunmen were preparing to fire again. He last saw Thoenes lying in the middle of the street.</p>

<p>Australian peacekeepers discovered Thoenes's body the next morning. Investigators determined that he was most likely murdered by members of Indonesian army Battalion 745. Thoenes died of a gunshot wound through the back, but his killers had also sliced off his left ear and made several cuts in his face, according to a coroner's report released on January 27, 2000. The mutilation is reportedly a signature of Battalion 745.</p>

<p>Thoenes, a seasoned journalist who had experience working in East Timor and Indonesia, was believed to be the first foreign reporter killed in East Timor since 1975, when six Australia-based reporters were killed during the Indonesian military invasion of East Timor.</p>

(<a href=""http://www.pravda.com.ua/"">www.pravda.com.ua</a>), which often featured critical articles about
President Leonid Kuchma and other Ukrainian government officials,
disappeared in Kyiv. In late November, a massive political scandal
erupted after an opposition leader released an audiotape that seemed to
implicate Kuchma and two senior aides in Gongadze's disappearance.<br />
          <br />
Gongadze, 31, left the home of a colleague at 10:20 p.m. to meet his
wife and two young children at home. He never arrived. The police
launched an investigation, while the Ukrainian Parliament formed a
special commission to examine the case.<br />
          <br />
Shortly after Gongadze disappeared, Deputy Interior Minister Mykola
Dzhyha announced that authorities were considering three possible
scenarios: that Gongadze had staged his own abduction, that he had been
involved in an accident, or that the abduction was related to his
journalism.<br />
          <br />
On September 19, however, Dzhyha announced that the police had ruled
out any political motive. The police then suggested that the
disappearance was related to Gongadze's personal life. CPJ expressed
serious doubts about the credibility of the investigation in a
September 25 letter to President Kuchma.<br />
          <br />
          On the night of November 2-3, a farmer discovered a headless corpse outside the town of<br />
          Tarashcha, and local journalists immediately speculated that it might be Gongadze's. On<br />
          November 6, regional officials visited Tarashcha to conduct an investigation.<br />
          <br />
The officials quickly announced that the advanced decomposition of the
body placed the time of death well before the date of Gongadze's
disappearance. They did not ask anyone from the journalist's family to
identify the body, however. Despite the local coroner's pleas to have
the body removed, it remained in an unrefrigerated morgue in Tarashcha,
where it continued to decompose.<br />
          <br />
Persistent rumors of a cover-up led several of Gongadze's colleagues to
visit Tarashcha on November 15. Based on jewelry found at the scene and
an X-ray of the corpse's hand, which showed an old shrapnel injury
matching one that Gongadze had suffered while covering the conflict in
Abkhazia, a region of Georgia, they concluded that the corpse was
indeed Gongadze's.<br />
          <br />
The local coroner issued a death certificate to the group confirming
their findings and offered to turn over the body to them. But when the
journalists returned to the morgue with a car and a coffin, they found
that the state prosecutor had already removed the corpse and
transported it to Kyiv for DNA testing. In late November, the
prosecutor's office launched a half-hearted effort to secure blood
samples from Gongadze's family, only obtaining the samples in
mid-December.<br />
          <br />
On November 28, Oleksandr Moroz, the leader of the Socialist Party and
a longtime rival of President Kuchma, released tape recordings of what
he claimed were conversations between Kuchma, Presidential Chief of
Staff Vladimir Litvin, and Interior Minister Yury Kravchenko. On the
tape, three male voices discuss various ways of ""dealing"" with
Gongadze. In casual, profanity-laced tones, they discuss undercover
surveillance, deporting him back to his native Georgia, prosecuting him
in Ukraine, or having a group of Chechens kidnap him. The speakers are
clearly concerned about Gongadze's journalism. ""You give me this same
one at <em>Ukrainska Pravda</em> and we will start to decide what to do with him,"" one says. ""He's simply gone too far.""<br />
          <br />
Moroz claimed he had received the tapes in mid-October from an unnamed
former officer of the Special Communication Detachment of Ukraine's
State Security Service (SBU) who was responsible for communications
security within President Kuchma's office, the <em>Kyiv Post</em>
reported. Moroz said he had delayed releasing the tapes until late
November in order to have them authenticated by foreign experts, and to
give the source's family time to leave the country.<br />
          <br />
In early December, three Ukrainian Parliament deputies traveled to an
undisclosed European Union country and videotaped their meeting with
the officer, who was identified as Mykola Melnychenko, a 34-year-old
major. On the video, Major Melnychenko claims that he secretly recorded
Kuchma's conversations by placing a digital audio recorder under a sofa
in the president's office. Melnychenko justifies his actions by saying,
""I gave my oath of allegiance to Ukraine, to the people of Ukraine. I
did not break my oath. I did not swear allegiance to Kuchma to perform
his criminal orders.""<br />
          <br />
At year's end, the tapes had not yet been authenticated by a neutral
third party. But it seemed credible for several reasons, according to a
CPJ source close to the investigation who did not wish to be
identified. The informal manner of speaking and frequent use of
expletives match Kuchma's conversational style. Also, researchers from
the Dutch Institute of Applied Scientific Research, hired by a Dutch
tabloid to evaluate the tapes, concluded that the recordings had not
been doctored, although they were unable to identify the voices
conclusively, the <em>Kyiv Post</em>
reported. And while Moroz was a bitter rival of Kuchma, he was known to
be relatively cautious in making accusations against other politicians,
particularly the president.<br />
          <br /> Kuchma flatly denied
that he had anything to do with Gongadze's disappearance and described
the Moroz tape as a ""provocation,"" according to the ITAR-TASS news
agency.<br />
          <br />
The government's agitated response to the scandal only fueled public
suspicion. A presidential spokesman denied Moroz's allegations on the
same day that he made them. Meanwhile, a local prosecutor announced he
was launching a criminal investigation into Moroz's alleged ""insults
and slander"" against President Kuchma.<br />
          <br />
On December 4, just as the allegations against Kuchma were gaining
momentum, Kyiv police announced that Gongadze had died in an attempted
robbery. But by then, public confidence in the investigation had
dwindled to a point where some opposition politicians were even
questioning whether the body being examined in Kyiv was the same corpse
that was found in Tarashcha.<br />
          <br />
On December 18, Gongadze's wife, Myroslava, identified the jewelry
found by the body in Tarashcha as belonging to her husband. And
although the corpse was badly decomposed, she claimed to recognize her
husband's foot.<br />
          <br />
In late December, German forensic experts determined that the corpse
found in Tarashcha was indeed Gongadze's, according to the German news
agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur. The Ukrainian government promised to
conduct DNA tests but had not yet done so by early January.",,,,,2000,UP,UA,.ua,Ukraine,ukraine,Europe,europe,europe,Ukraine,Confirmed

 The Mozambican government quickly condemned Cardoso's assassination and promised to carry out a full investigation.<br />

 Cardoso, 48, was an experienced investigative journalist who had become one of Mozambique's foremost media personalities. He was internationally acclaimed for his groundbreaking reporting on political corruption and organized crime in Mozambique, a country that is still recovering from a brutal, 17-year civil war.<br />
 <br />
 Earlier in his career, Cardoso served as editor and later director of the Mozambique state news agency AIM, from which he resigned in 1989. Before founding <em>Metical</em> in 1998, Cardoso ran another independent fax newsletter, <em>Mediafax</em>, which he launched in 1992. He sympathized politically with the ruling FRELIMO party but often lambasted the government in his editorials.<br />
 <br />
 One week before his death, Cardoso started a campaign against what he called the ""gangster faction"" in FRELIMO, which he accused of provoking recent political violence in the country. <em>Metical</em> had also been reporting aggressively on alleged wrongdoing at the Mozambique Commercial Bank (BCM), according to the London-based anti-censorship organization ARTICLE 19.<br />
 <br />
 On the day of Cardoso's assassination, unknown attackers slashed the tongue of Radio Mozambique journalist Custadio Rafael for ""speaking too much,"" according to news reports. Rafael had also been investigating the BCM scandal.<br />

 Local human rights groups, government officials, and opposition leaders all condemned the killing. Outside Mozambique, the U.S. State Department, the European Union, and several African nations denounced Cardoso's murder as a serious setback to press freedom in Mozambique.<br />

 His murder came two weeks after a colleague, Guillermo León Agudelo, was stabbed to death by two men who had forced their way into his home.<br />

 Florencia police chief Col. Henry Calderón told CPJ that Abad, 36, was sitting in his car talking to his wife at 5:50 a.m. when two men drove up on a red motorcycle and fired a volley of bullets at point-blank range from a 9mm semiautomatic pistol and a .38 revolver. He was hit by at least four shots in the stomach, chest, and head.<br />

 Florencia, in southern Caquetá province, is a former stronghold of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a Marxist guerrilla organization.

about 250 km (150 miles) from Asunción, was ambushed and shot by an
unidentified gunman.<br />
<br />
The journalist was driving a motorcycle with his brother Gaspar when a
masked attacker came out from behind some bushes and shot him in the
left side at point-blank range. The attacker then fled into the bush,
according to local press reports. Medina lost control of his
motorcycle, fell to the ground, and died immediately.<br />
<br />
The journalist's family linked the attack to his reports on timber
smuggling in state-owned forest reservations in Capiibary, local
sources told CPJ. In particular, Medina had singled out a gang of
alleged smugglers with ties to the National Republican Association
(ARN), also known as the Colorado Party.<br />
<br />
One of those whom Medina had accused was arrested in March for timber
smuggling. In addition, Medina had covered incidents of livestock
theft, along with organized crime in a nearby town.<br />
<br />
In January and February, the Paraguayan police arrested four men
suspected of killing Medina, but at least four other suspects were
still at large.<br />
<br />
In a hearing on September 6, Public Prosecutor Ramón Trinidad Zelaya
charged Milcíades Maylin, one of the four suspects in police custody,
with Medina's murder. Judge Silvio Flores granted Trinidad's request
that the charges against the three other suspects be dismissed.<br />

On October 16, a three-judge sentencing tribunal found Maylin guilty of

Friends and relatives of the journalist linked his murder to a front-page story in the February 15 issue of <em>Semanario de Ojinaga</em> reporting that the federal Attorney General's Office (PGR) was investigating drug trafficking activities in the town of Aldama, near the state capital, Chihuahua. <em>Semanario de Ojinaga</em> also claimed that local traffickers were moving drugs from safe houses in Aldama through Ojinaga to the United States.<br />

In addition, the Chihuahua Attorney General's Office was unable to provide a motive and offered no other evidence.

The two journalists, who had just finished the first broadcast of their twice-daily news program, were driving home from work in Florencia, a city in southern Caquetá Department that is a former stronghold of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the country's largest leftist guerrilla group. More recently, the town has become a power base for an anti-Communist paramilitary group linked to the right-wing United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC).<br />
<br />
García told CPJ that the gunman first shot Vásquez and then aimed at him. Vásquez's slumped body intercepted the second bullet, which merely brushed García, who was able to give the authorities a detailed description of the killer. The next day, García began receiving threatening phone calls. On July 9, an anonymous caller warned him to leave Florencia on pain of death.<br />
<br />
In addition to witnessing the killing, García had assisted Vásquez in documenting corruption implicating local government officials and members of the FARC, the journalist told CPJ.<br />
<br />
The journalists had also investigated Caquetá governor Pablo Adriano Muñoz, who was reportedly elected with support from the FARC, for allegedly embezzling public funds. Muñoz accused Vásquez of ""persecuting"" him, whereupon Vásquez filed a defamation suit against the governor. Vásquez's lawyer, Carlos Alberto Beltrán, had to flee Florencia after a failed attempt on his life, according to García.<br />
<br />
Vásquez stated during one of his broadcasts that if anything happened to him or his family, it would be the governor's fault.<br />
<br />
García reported that Vásquez's last broadcasts dealt with an AUC communiqué in which the organization announced changes in its local leadership and promised to refrain from kidnapping and extortion.<br />

<br />
Soon after the attack, Donetsk regional prosecutor Viktor Pshonka
launched an official investigation. The chief of the Donetsk
Administration of Internal Affairs, Gen. Vladimir Malyshev, stated that
revenge was the leading motive in the murder but did not elaborate.<br />
<br />
Aleksandrov became well known in 1998, when prosecutors brought a
criminal case against him for insulting the honor and dignity of a
parliamentary deputy. The Slavyansk City Court initially found the
journalist guilty but later reviewed its decision after criticism from
Ukrainian journalists and international human rights organizations.<br />
<br />
The deputy withdrew his defamation complaint against the journalist
last year. That removed the immediate legal threat but did not clear
Aleksandrov's name, since his conviction was still technically under
review. Claiming damage to his professional reputation, Aleksandrov
appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, where the case was
pending at the time of his murder.<br />
<br />
In late August, law enforcement officials arrested an unnamed suspect,
according to local press reports. The officials claimed that
Aleksandrov's murder was a case of mistaken identity and was not
connected with his journalism.<br />
<br />
A parliamentary investigative commission was established in September
to examine Aleksandrov's murder. In December, the commission voiced its
doubts about the validity of the ""mistaken identity"" theory and stated
that it knew who had really killed Aleksandrov, according to local
reports.<br />
<br />
While the commission refused to forward this information to law
enforcement officials, it accused the Ukrainian Security Service of
falsifying evidence in the case.<br />
<br />
In mid-December, the General Prosecutor's Office officially charged the
suspect detained in August, Yury Verdyuk, with Aleksdandrov's murder,
local and international sources reported. On December 27, the Donetsk
Regional Court scheduled Verdyuk's trial for September 11, 2002.<br />

his Tbilisi apartment. He had been shot once in the head at close range
with a 9 mm weapon. Sanaya anchored ""Night Courier,"" a nightly
political talk show in which he interviewed Georgia's leading
politicians on the independent television station Rustavi-2.<br />
<br />
Nika Tabatadze, news director of Rustavi-2, told CPJ that Sanaya's
colleagues became concerned when he failed to report for work at the
usual time on the afternoon of July 26 and did not answer his home or
cellular telephones. That evening, a group of co-workers went to his
apartment and knocked repeatedly on the door. When no one answered,
they called the police, who entered the apartment and discovered
Sanaya's body.<br />
<br />
In a special television address, President Eduard Shevardnadze directed
the minister of internal affairs, the prosecutor general, and the
minister of state security to oversee the investigation personally. On
July 27, President Shevardnadze met with U.S. chargé d'affaires Philip
Remler and asked for the FBI's help in the investigation, according to
Georgian and Russian press sources.<br />
<br />
Although the police, assisted by a group of FBI agents, immediately
launched an investigation, it failed to produce significant results. A
suspect was detained in August but was later released due to lack of
evidence, CPJ sources reported.<br />
<br />
Sanaya's Rustavi-2 colleagues firmly believe that the murder resulted
from his professional work, although they were not aware of any
specific threats against the journalist. Erosi Kitsmarishvili,
executive director of Rustavi-2, told CPJ that the murder could have
been intended to intimidate the station, which is known for its
investigative reporting on state corruption and misuse of power in
Georgia. The station has frequently been the target of government
harassment in recent years.<br />
<br />
While Sanaya's work was not generally controversial, he had recently
hosted a segment on Georgia's Pankisi Gorge, a lawless area near the
Chechen border that is known for drug smuggling and kidnapping. A
former parliamentary deputy who appeared on the program speculated
publicly that criminals from the Pankisi Gorge region may have been
responsible for Sanaya's murder.<br />
<br />
On December 6, police arrested former police officer Grigol Khurtsilava
after a ballistic analysis traced the murder weapon to him, the
Georgian news agency Black Sea Press reported. Acting on his
confession, police found the murder weapon and keys to Sanaya's
apartment. Khurtsilava was then officially charged with Sanaya's
murder, local and international sources reported.",,,,,2001,GG,GE,.ge,Georgia,georgia,Europe,europe,europe,Georgia,Confirmed

Alegría, who also worked as a part-time correspondent for the national
radio network Emisoras Unidas, had reportedly been threatened on three
different occasions after broadcasting stories about corruption. In
addition, one of his colleagues told the press that local officials had
tried to bribe Alegría to keep him quiet about their activities.<br />
<br />
Police detained two suspects in connection with Alegría's murder. One
suspect had a 9 mm handgun whose bullets apparently matched those found
at the crime scene. Preliminary investigations by the Puerto Barrios
prosecutor's office revealed that the handgun had recently fired six
shots.<br />
<br />
CPJ published a news alert about the murder on September 18.<br />
<br />
On September 20, the Ombudsman's Office for Human Rights (PDH) released
the results of its investigations. The report concluded that Alegría's
murder was politically motivated and was probably masterminded by local
officials in retaliation for the journalist's coverage of corruption in
Puerto Barrios. The PDH added that the two suspects in police custody
were scapegoats. A report with the PDH's findings was sent to the newly
created Prosecutor's Office for Crimes against Journalists.<br />

proved that the confiscated handgun was not the murder weapon.<br />

O'Hagan was shot several times from a passing car while walking home
from a pub with his wife, who was not hurt in the attack. The vehicle
used in the attack was found on fire not far from the crime scene.
O'Hagan, who worked in the Belfast office of the <em>Sunday World</em>,
was an Irish Catholic journalist who had become well known for his
coverage of both Catholic and Protestant paramilitary groups.<br />
<br />
More than 20 years ago, before he became a journalist, O'Hagan was
convicted of running guns for the Irish Republican Army and served five
years in prison. But he later turned away from radical politics,
studying sociology at the Open University and the University of Ulster
and then entering journalism as a freelancer for local newspapers. His
connections in both Catholic Republican and Protestant Loyalist
circles, as well as in the British security forces, gave him unusual
insight into the conflict but also made him a target for paramilitary
reprisals.<br />
<br />
In 1989, he was kidnapped and interrogated by the Irish Republican
Army, which tried unsuccessfully to force him to divulge his sources,
and in the early 1990s he was forced to flee to Dublin after receiving
death threats from a top loyalist gunman. O'Hagan returned to Belfast
in 1995 after most paramilitary groups had declared cease-fires.<br />
<br />
While O'Hagan had received threats from Protestant militants in the
past, it is not clear if he had been threatened prior to the shooting.
The Red Hand Defenders, which police consider a cover name for
Protestant militants from the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) and the
Ulster Defense Association, claimed responsibility for his murder.<br />
<br />
Police initially identified the LVF as a primary suspect. Prior to his
murder, O'Hagan had been working on several stories about the LVF, the

 <br />
 The exact date of his murder was uncertain, but authorities announced his death after receiving a graphic, three-and-a-half minute digital videotape containing scenes in which one of the killers slits Pearl's throat, and then someone holds his severed head. The faces of the assailants are not visible on the video, according to news reports.<br />
 <br />
 Pearl, 38, went missing on January 23 in the port city of Karachi, Pakistan, and was last seen on his way to an interview at the Village Restaurant, downtown near the Metropole Hotel. According to <em>The</em> <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, Pearl had been reporting on Richard Reid, a suspected terrorist who allegedly tried to blow up an airplane during a transatlantic flight with a bomb in his shoe.<br />
 <br />
 Four days after his disappearance, a group calling itself ""The National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty"" sent an e-mail to several U.S.- and Pakistan-based news organizations claiming responsibility for kidnapping Pearl and accusing him of being an American spy. The e-mail also contained four photographs of the journalist, including one in which he is held at gunpoint and another in which he is holding a copy of the January 24 issue of Pakistan's <em>Dawn</em> newspaper.<br />
 <br />
 The e-mail contained a series of demands, including the repatriation of Pakistani detainees held by the U.S. Army in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The sender or senders, who used a Hotmail e-mail account under the name ""Kidnapperguy,"" said Pearl was ""at present being kept in very inhuman circumstances quite similar infact [<em>sic</em>] to the way that Pakistanis and nationals of other sovereign countries are being kept in Cuba by the American Army.""<br />
 <br />
 Another e-mail was sent on January 30, also including photographs of Pearl held captive. This e-mail accused him of being an agent of Mossad, Israel's spy agency, and said he would be killed within 24 hours unless the group's demands were met.<br />
 <br />
 After scrutinizing the videotape that officials received weeks later, authorities believe that Pearl may have been murdered before the second e-mail was sent. During that footage, Pearl is forced to identify himself as Jewish and to deliver scripted lines reiterating some of the demands made in the e-mails, according to an FBI analysis of the tape that was provided to the <em>Journal</em>.<br />
 <br />
 On February 12, before Pearl's murder was discovered, Pakistani police announced the arrest of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, whom they identified as the prime suspect behind the journalist's kidnapping.<br />
 <br />
 On March 14, a U.S. grand jury indicted Saeed, charging him with hostage-taking and conspiracy to commit hostage-taking resulting in Pearl's murder. U.S. prosecutors also unsealed a secret indictment filed against Saeed in November 2001 accusing him of participating in the 1994 kidnapping of U.S. tourist Bela Nuss in India. Pakistan refused to extradite Saeed, possibly to avoid damaging disclosures of links between the country's intelligence agencies and militant Islamist groups that the United States wants to see eliminated.<br />
 <br />
 In April, Saeed and three accomplices--Salman Saqib, Fahad Naseem, and Shaikh Adil--were charged with Pearl's kidnapping and murder before Pakistan's special anti-terrorism court. The trial, initially convened at Karachi's Central Jail and later moved to a heavily guarded prison in Hyderabad due to security concerns, was closed to journalists and the public.<br />
 <br />
 In mid-May, as the trial was under way, police found a dismembered body believed to be Pearl's buried in the outskirts of Karachi on property owned by the Al-Rashid Trust, an Islamic charity that the United States has accused of funneling money to al-Qaeda. Police were reportedly led to the shallow grave by Fazal Karim, a member of the banned militant Sunni Muslim group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. At year's end, Karim had not been charged, and though it has been widely reported that he was detained, authorities have never officially acknowledged his arrest.<br />
 <br />
 On July 15, the anti-terrorism court announced that Saeed and his accomplices were guilty of Pearl's kidnapping and murder. Saeed, who was accused of masterminding the crime, was sentenced to death by hanging; Saqib, Naseem, and Adil each received 25-year prison sentences. They have appealed the ruling, and the case was still pending at year's end.<br />
 <br />
 Shortly after the ruling, U.S. officials announced DNA test results confirming that the body found in May was indeed Pearl's.<br />
 <br />
 In mid-August, The Associated Press (AP) published a detailed account of Pearl's kidnapping, citing two investigators who spoke on condition of anonymity. The officials said that, according to Karim (who had led police to the journalist's body in May) and two others held in unofficial custody, Pearl was shot and wounded on the sixth day of his capture when he tried to escape and was murdered on the ninth day. The AP identified the two other detainees as Zubair Chishti and Naeem Bukhari, who is also known as Attaur Rehman and is a leader of the sectarian group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. The men also said that three Arabs, possibly from Yemen, were brought to the hideout on the ninth day, and that they were involved in filming and carrying out the execution.<br />
 <br />
 Karim later identified one of the Yemenis among those arrested in a September 11, 2002, raid in Karachi, during which U.S. and Pakistani authorities detained several suspected al-Qaeda members, including Ramzi Binalshibh, allegedly a senior al-Qaeda leader who has claimed a central role in coordinating the September 11 attacks.<br />
 <br />
 <em>The Washington Post</em> reported that Karim and Bukhari ""have told police that the man who slit Pearl's throat was Khalid Sheik Mohammed,"" whom U.S. intelligence officials have identified as the current head of al-Qaeda's military operations. U.S. officials have told journalists that Mohammed was not among those captured in the Karachi raids, and that his current status is unclear. He had appeared with Binalshibh in a pre-recorded interview broadcast by the Qatar-based Arabic-language satellite channel Al-Jazeera to coincide with the anniversary of the September 11 attacks.<br />
 <br />
 A former U.S. intelligence officer, Robert Baer, told the United Press International (UPI) news agency that he had given Pearl information about Mohammed, and that he believes it was the journalist's investigations of Mohammed that may have cost him his life. Baer, who worked for the Central Intelligence Agency for more than 20 years in Asia and the Middle East and wrote the book <em>See No Evil</em>, which criticizes the CIA, told UPI, ""I have heard from [intelligence] people who follow this closely that it was people close to Mohammed that killed him, if it wasn't Mohammed himself.""<br />
 <br />
 UPI quoted a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> spokesperson as saying that, ""Everything we know from before and after Danny's murder indicates his reporting effort focused on [alleged shoe bomber] Richard Reid.""",,,,,2002,PK,PK,.pk,Pakistan,pakistan,Asia,asia,asia,Pakistan,Confirmed

He died on February 1.</p>
<p>Sierra wrote a Sunday column for the 80-year-old newspaper in which he frequently highlighted political corruption and human rights abuses committed by leftist guerrillas, a rival right-wing paramilitary army, and state security agents, said Alvaro Segura López, editor of <i>La Patria</i>.</p>
<p>However, the 42-year-old journalist was most critical of local political bosses who, according to a March 6 editorial in <i>El Tiempo</i>, Colombia's top daily newspaper, ""run the department like a feudal colony."" Sierra frequently accused prominent politicians from the local Liberal and Conservative parties of nepotism, vote buying, and looting public coffers.</p>
<p>Following death threats in 1998, Sierra was assigned bodyguards for a short period but later stopped using them, according to a joint investigation into the journalist's murder carried out by seven of Colombia's leading newspapers and news magazines.</p>
<p>The threats came after regional assemblyman Francisco Ferney Tapasco González was removed from office after authorities discovered that in the 1970s he had been convicted of selling military ration cards while serving as the mayor of Supia, Caldas Department, according to the investigation.</p>
<p>Sierra publicly backed the legal process to remove Tapasco and also used his weekly column to revisit another incident in which the lawmaker was convicted of concealing information about the 1991 murder of a schoolteacher in Caldas, according to the investigation.</p>
<p>Since April 2001, Sierra had also been investigating possible links between Tapasco and a gang of assassins. Shortly before his death he had told colleagues that if anything happened to him Tapasco would be to blame. The former politician denied involvement in the killing.</p>
<p>On the same day Sierra was shot, police arrested 21-year-old Luis Fernando Soto Zapata, who later confessed to having shot Sierra and was sentenced on May 8, 2002, to 19 and a half years in prison.</p>
<p>Soto told the court that he shot Sierra on a whim after mistaking him for a man who allegedly killed a relative several years ago. However, a public prosecutor told CPJ that he doubted the claim, pointing out that footage from a hidden police camera showed Soto lingering for more than two hours before the shooting at the spot where Sierra was killed.</p>
<p>Police also arrested Luis Arley Ortiz on the day Sierra was shot. Authorities released Ortiz soon after, but issued a warrant for his arrest again in May 2, alleging that he acted as a middleman between a gang of assassins and the person or people who allegedly ordered Sierra's death. He was convicted, along with Luis Tabares Hernández, also known as Tilín, to 28 years in prison.</p>
<p>On July 17, authorities charged Francisco Antonio Quintero Tabares with homicide for Sierra's killing. Quintero is believed to be the boss of the gang of hit men that allegedly included Soto.</p>
<p>Fearing the Sierra murder would remain unsolved, seven Colombian newspapers and magazines formed <a href=""http://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/ferney-tapasco-salio-de-la-carcel/369524-3"" target=""_blank"">Project Manizales</a> to try to investigate the case. The Sierra killing was also the subject of a documentary, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keilDiuWYwo"" target=""_blank"">""The Battle of Silence.""</a> In the ensuing years, at least nine witnesses were murdered, the Bogotá-based Foundation for Press Freedom (FLIP) said in a <a href=""http://flip.org.co/es/content/tribunal-condena-36-a%C3%B1os-al-excongresista-liberal-ferney-tapasco-por-el-homicidio-del"" target=""_blank"">statement</a>.</p>
<p>In 2011, nine years after Sierra was killed, authorities charged Tapasco with being one of the suspected masterminds of the crime. Tapasco was also convicted in 2010 for working with paramilitary death squads, according to <a href=""http://www.eluniversal.com.co/cartagena/nacional/condenan-ferney-tapasco-60-meses-de-prision-por-parapolitica-34061"" target=""_blank"">news reports</a>.

In June 2015, he was <a href=""/2015/06/historic-conviction-of-mastermind-in-colombian-jou.php"">convicted</a> in absentia and sentenced to 36 years in prison.

<p>The court also convicted Fabio López Escobar and Jorge Hernando López Escobar of murder in the Sierra case and sentenced them in absentia to nearly 29 years in prison.

at the hospital told the Dhaka-based newspaper <em>The Independent</em> that Rashid had suffered a fatal bullet wound to his chest.<br />
          <br />
Rashid, also known as Rashid Khukon, was a crime reporter who had
written several stories on official corruption and links between
criminal syndicates and outlawed Maoist guerrilla groups, including the
Purbo Bangla Communist Party (PBCP). Rashid's relatives told reporters
that he was on a PBCP hit list. Though the PBCP issued a statement
denying responsibility for Rashid's murder, some colleagues said a

 <br />
 Late on the night of March 8, Skryl was returning to her home in the town of Taganrog, just outside Rostov-on-Don, when she was attacked from behind and struck in the head about a dozen times with a heavy, blunt object.<br />
 <br />
 Neighbors called an ambulance and the police after hearing her scream. Skryl was found unconscious just outside her home and taken to Taganrog Hospital, where she died the following day.<br />
 <br />
 Skryl, 29, reported on local business issues for a newspaper owned by Rostov regional authorities. Just before her death, she was investigating an ongoing struggle for the control of Tagmet, a local metallurgical plant. <em>Nashe Vremya</em> editor-in-chief Vera Yuzhanskaya believes that Skryl's death was related to her professional activities, the ITAR-TASS news agency reported.<br />
 <br />
 Since opening an investigation shortly after the murder, officials have changed their theories several times. Initially, the prosecutor's office said that because Skryl was carrying jewelry and a large sum of cash that were not taken at the time of her murder, robbery could be ruled out as a motive.<br />
 <br />
 But on July 24, the Taganrog Directorate of Internal Affairs announced that robbery was the motive, and that the crime was unrelated to her journalistic activities, the Ekho Rosotova radio station reported.<br />
 <br />
 Taganrog authorities switched their story yet again on September 5, <em>Nashe Vremya</em> editor-in-chief Vera Yuzhanskaya told CPJ, when they closed the murder investigation without officially identifying the reason for the murder.<br />
 <br />
 Grigory Bochkarov, a local analyst in Rostov-on-Don for the Moscow-based Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations, told CPJ that the only credible motive for Skryl's murder was her reporting about Tagmet and that police had emphasized the robbery motive in an effort to play down the significance of the case.<br />
 <br />
 Just prior to her death, Skryl reportedly told several colleagues that she had recently obtained sensitive information about the Tagmet story and was planning to publish an article revealing this information.",,,,,2002,RS,RU,.ru,Russia,russia,Europe,europe,europe,Russia,Confirmed

 Ciriello, an Italian freelance photographer who was on assignment for the Italian daily <em>Corriere della Sera</em>, was killed by Israeli gunfire in the West Bank city of Ramallah, according to press reports and eyewitness testimony. Ciriello was the first foreign journalist killed while covering the current Palestinian uprising, which began in September 2000. The photographer died after being hit by a burst of machine gun fire from the direction of an Israeli tank during an Israeli military offensive in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.<br />
 <br />
 Amedeo Ricucci of the Italian television station Rai Uno told CPJ that he and his cameraman were accompanying Ciriello and trailing a group of Palestinian gunmen at the time of the incident. Ricucci said the area was quiet and was located roughly 500 yards (455 meters) to a half-mile (0.8 kilometers) from a nearby refugee camp where fighting between Israelis and Palestinians was taking place.<br />
 <br />
 The three journalists were standing inside a building off an alleyway, Ricucci said. Shortly afterward, a tank emerged at one end of the street 150 to 200 yards (135 to 180 meters) away, he said. Ciriello left the building and pointed his camera at the tank. He then came under fire without warning. Ciriello was shot six times and died of his wounds soon after.<br />
 <br />
 At least one Palestinian gunman was in Ciriello's vicinity at the time of the shooting, according to press reports. The Italian government has demanded a full investigation into the attack.<br />
 <br />
 After Ciriello's death, an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson was unable to provide details about the circumstances of the shooting and claimed to have no information about the presence of journalists in Ramallah, which the IDF said was a closed military area at the time. The IDF added that journalists who entered the area were ""endangering"" themselves.<br />

 Tortoza, 48, a photographer for the Caracas daily <em>2001</em>, was shot on the afternoon of April 11 while covering violent clashes between opposition demonstrators and government supporters in the capital, Caracas. He died later that evening.<br />
 <br />
 The journalist, who was carrying his camera and wearing a vest identifying him as a member of the press, was standing on a corner near Caracas City Hall when he was shot in the head at around 4 p.m. He was then taken to José María Vargas Hospital and died at around 6 p.m.<br />
 <br />
 The clashes came on the third day of a nationwide strike leading to a short-lived coup that ousted President Hugo Chávez Frías on April 11. He returned to power on April 14.<br />
 <br />
 Several videos made public the following week did not show conclusively where the shots that killed the journalist had come from, or who fired them, according to local press reports. However, the Caracas Metropolitan Police released a video revealing that five gunmen were on the roof of the City Hall at the time of Tortoza's shooting.<br />
 <br />
 None of the gunmen were in uniform, but two of them had on bulletproof vests. Other videos taken by amateur cameramen show more unidentified gunmen in adjacent buildings. Eyewitness accounts and videos implicate both the Venezuelan National Guard and the Caracas Metropolitan Police in the shooting.<br />
 <br />
 Eurídice Ledezma, a Venezuelan journalist and political analyst, told CPJ that Tortoza was shot by a gunman she saw firing from the roof of City Hall.<br />
 <br />
 Tortoza, a veteran photographer, had worked for <em>2001</em> since 1991. On April 25, about 300 reporters, photographers, and cameramen from both the private and state media held a march to pay homage to Tortoza. The journalists, who held posters with Tortoza's picture, demanded that those responsible for his death be punished, and that journalists be allowed to do their job without fear of reprisal.<br />
 <br />
 During the events of April 11, at least 15 people were killed and dozens were injured, including four journalists.<br />
 <br />
 By late October, the investigation into Tortoza's killing had stalled. According to the Venezuelan human rights organization PROVEA, there were conflicting reports as to which type of weapon had been used to shoot the journalist and from which direction the bullet came.

 <br />
 Walter López, who was driving Sandoval and his crew, was also shot and killed during the firefight, said Rocío Arias, executive producer of RCN Televisión news.<br />
 <br />
 The journalists came under fire on April 11 at around 1:45 p.m. in a mountainous region outside the southwestern city of Cali where the army was pursuing fighters from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The rebels had just kidnapped 13 provincial lawmakers and four aides and were apparently seeking refuge when the army launched an operation to free the captives.<br />
 <br />
 The crew had decided to leave when an army helicopter hovering above opened fire on their vehicle, said Juan Bautista Díaz, a freelance photographer working for <em>Semana</em> newsmagazine. The letters ""RCN"" were marked in large, bright colors on the roof and both sides of the vehicle, according to both Arias and Bautista.<br />
 <br />
 A bullet pierced the roof and tore through López's arm and into his body. According to Bautista, he appeared to have died instantly, but his colleagues were trying to apply a tourniquet when the army helicopter resumed fire. They were forced to flee for cover in a nearby ravine, said Bautista.<br />
 <br />
 The journalists then tried to signal the helicopter for help by waving white T-shirts in the air. Fifteen minutes after López was shot, a bullet from the helicopter ripped through Sandoval's left leg, said Bautista.<br />
 <br />
 Continued fighting forced Bautista, Sandoval, and RCN correspondent Luz Estela Arroyave to hide in the ravine for about two hours before journalists from a local newspaper who had also come to cover the fighting took them to a hospital. Sandoval died several hours after arriving at the hospital due to significant blood loss from the bullet wound.<br />

 <br />
 A gunman shot Damalerio, 32, while he was driving home in his jeep from a press conference in Pagadian City. He was killed by a single bullet wound to his left torso.<br />
 <br />
 On May 16, local police superintendent Asuri Hawani announced that police had identified and filed charges against an alleged hit man named Ronie Quilme based on an eyewitness' account. But the two witnesses riding in Damalerio's jeep, Edgar Amoro and Edgar Ongue, identified the gunman as local police officer Guillermo Wapile. Although an investigator from the National Bureau of Investigation said his office had recommended as early as May 17 that local prosecutors arrest Wapile, the suspect was not formally arrested. Instead, he was placed in the custody of his boss, Hawani, under ""restricted supervision"" with his fellow police officers. He was not formally charged, and could move freely in Pagadian City. According to news reports, he was seen in town stalking the witnesses and their family members during 2002.<br />
 <br />
 CPJ believes that Damalerio, known for his critiques of corruption among local politicians and the police, was killed for his journalistic work. According to local news reports, the journalist had criticized Hawani on his radio show for his alleged involvement with drug traffickers and crime syndicates.<br />
 <br />
 The day of Damalerio's murder, his wife alerted him that she had noticed two men ""casing the house,"" according to a report in the Philippine Daily Inquirer by Hernan de la Cruz, publisher of the Zamboanga Scribe. Damalerio called his wife 30 minutes before he was killed to let her know that he was on his way home. The journalist advised her to ""just close the door and lock the gate. Be careful.""<br />
 <br />
 A few hours before Damalerio was shot, an employee of the Zamboanga Scribe reported receiving a number of mysterious anonymous telephone calls. On May 14, the day after the journalist's death, an unidentified male made threatening phone calls to the newspaper warning that publisher de la Cruz may be next. (De la Cruz now has a uniformed army soldier as his bodyguard.)<br />
 <br />
 On August 10, a possible third witness in the case, a member of a local civilian militia named Juvy Lovitaño, was murdered. He had recently contacted the National Bureau of Investigation to report that a local police officer had approached him to take out a contract on Damalerio's life.<br />
 <br />
 In August 2002, CPJ conducted an in-depth investigation into Damalerio's murder and met with government officials, including Interior Secretary Joey Lina, to try to move prosecution efforts forward. Lina, who dismissed Pagadian police chief Asuri Hawani after Damalerio's assassination for ""covering up the crimes of his men,"" has ordered a special investigation into the murder.<br />
 <br />
 Amoro and Ongue, the two witnesses riding in the car with Damalerio when he was shot, were under threat and went into the witness protection program. Fearing death threats against her and her baby boy, Damalerio's widow, Gemma, went into hiding in another province under the protection program. Despite the risks for their own safety, Damalerio's family and colleagues continued to pressure regional authorities for justice.<br />
 <br />
 On January 30, 2003, the Pagadian City regional trial court ordered Wapile's arrest. Wapile had been temporarily reassigned at the time to Camp Abelon in Pagadian City, where he was supposed to be restricted to the premises under the supervision of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Provincial Director Pedrito Reye.<br />
 <br />
 Apparently tipped off, Wapile managed to escape and evaded arrest for more than a year. In mid-2004, with a missing suspect and no leads, the case became ""dormant"" and Damlerio's widow, Amoro and Ongue lost their protection despite ongoing threats.<br />
 <br />
 International and domestic pressure to solve the Damalerio murder case increased until Wapile surrendered to authorities on murder charges on September 13, 2004. He pleaded not guilty to the murder charges on September 24, 2004.<br />
 <br />
 But Wapile's arrest did not end the reign of terror for the eyewitnesses and family members. On February 5, 2005, gunmen shot and killed Amoro while he was leaving Zamboanga del Sur National High School where he worked as a teacher. Two of the three eyewitnesses to Damalierio's murder have been murdered to keep them from testifying in court.<br />
 <br />
 In a February 14 ruling, the Supreme Court granted the request of Damalerio's widow to transfer the trial from Pagadian City to the more neutral Cebu City, 350 miles south of Manila. The Supreme Court also ordered the Cebu City court to ensure a speedy trial.<br />
 <br />
 Prison authorities were ordered to transfer Wapile from Pagadian City to Cebu City and ensure security to prevent another escape. There is still no official start date for the trial. According to local journalists, the prosecution is modifying its case, possibly to include charges against former Pagadian City Police Chief Azuri Hawani.<br />

 According to the Rio de Janeiro Civil Police, two suspects, both members of a gang headed by local drug trafficker Elias Pereira da Silva, also known as ""Crazy Elias,"" were arrested on the morning of June 9. Both men claimed that they heard how Lopes was murdered but denied any involvement in his killing.<br />
 <br />
 According to the suspects' depositions, details of which the police released and the Brazilian press published, drug traffickers close to Pereira da Silva kidnapped Lopes in Vila Cruzeiro at around midnight on June 2. After Lopes told them he was a TV Globo reporter, the traffickers called Pereira da Silva, who was in a nearby favela.<br />
 <br />
 They tied Lopes' hands, forced him into a car, and took him to the favela where Pereira da Silva was staying. There, they beat the reporter and shot him in the feet to keep him from escaping. They then held a mock trial and sentenced Lopes to death.<br />
 <br />
 Pereira da Silva killed Lopes with a sword, and his body was burned and put in a hidden burial ground, said the suspects.<br />
 <br />
 On June 12, police found badly decomposed human remains, along with Lopes' camera and watch in Favela da Grota. After DNA tests, police confirmed on July 5 that the remains belonged to Lopes. Two days later, they were officially buried.<br />
 <br />
 Lopes had received Brazil's most important journalism award in December 2001 for a TV Globo report on drug trafficking. The report, titled ""Drug Fair,"" and broadcast in August 2001, was filmed with a hidden camera and showed how traffickers sold drugs in a makeshift open drug market in a favela outside Rio de Janeiro. Reporter Cristina Guimarães, who co-produced the piece with Lopes and two other colleagues, received death threats in September 2001 and had to leave Rio de Janeiro State, according to the daily <em>O Estado de S. Paulo</em>. The daily <em>Jornal do Brasil</em> reported that Lopes had also received threats for the report.<br />
 <br />
 On September 19, after a two-day search, police apprehended drug lord Pereira da Silva. In early August, several members of his gang who had also been charged with murdering the journalist were either arrested or killed in a shoot-out with the police. <br />
 At year's end, Pereira da Silva and his accomplices remained in jail. No date had been set for trial.",,,,,2002,BR,BR,.br,Brazil,brazil,Americas,americas,americas,Brazil,Confirmed

 <br />
 The journalist, who had recently alerted the public to the presence of paramilitary fighters in the region, was driving home from a university graduation in Arauca Department in the afternoon when gunmen yanked him from his car and shot him in the face and chest, said Col. Jorge Caro, acting commander of Arauca's police.<br />
 <br />
 Varela hosted two polemical news and opinion programs for the station in the town of Arauca and criticized all sides fighting in Colombia's civil conflict, according to José Gutiérrez, who co-hosted an afternoon program called ""Let's Talk Politics"" with Varela.<br />
 <br />
 A few days before the killing, Varela had told listeners during his morning news show that fighters from the paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) had arrived in Arauca, which is on the border with Venezuela, and were patrolling the town's streets, according to Gutiérrez.<br />
 <br />
 Tensions have been building in the oil-rich area since early June, when the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) began threatening to kill civil servants in the region who refused to resign. The rebels are battling the paramilitary army for control over lucrative territory not only in Arauca but throughout the country.<br />
 <br />
 Three years ago, Varela's name appeared on a list of people that the paramilitary army had declared military targets, said acting police commander Caro, adding that authorities were investigating rumors that the AUC was responsible for the killing. Caro, a frequent listener of the station, said that Varela seemed to reserve his sharpest criticism for the paramilitaries.<br />
 <br />
 A spokesperson for the Public Prosecutor's Office told CPJ in mid-December that authorities have issued an arrest warrant for a paramilitary commander believed to have been involved in the killing. The spokesperson said it wasn't known when the warrant was issued and refused to reveal the name of the paramilitary leader for fear of jeopardizing the search for him.<br />
 <br />
 Varela, who was in his early 50s, was also the secretary of a provincial peace commission as well as its former president, said Evelyn Varela, his 28-year-old daughter and Radio Meridiano-70's manager. In recent months, Varela had begun warning his only child that his life could be in danger.

 Hossain, a crime reporter for the Khulna-based newspaper <em>Anirban</em>, was kidnapped from his home in Ula, a village near the town of Dumuria, Khulna District, at around midnight by a group of about 35 armed men. Police suspect that the assailants belonged to the outlawed Biplobi Communist Party, one of several guerrilla groups active in the lawless southwest of the country.<br />
 <br />
 Hossain was last seen alive on the banks of the Ghangrail River, according to the national English-language newspaper <em>The Daily Star</em>. Two villagers who were in the area at the time said that they heard shots fired. Although police could not confirm whether Hossain was murdered at the time, his colleagues and his family believe that he was killed.<br />
 <br />
 An investigation published in the Bangla-language daily <em>Janakantha</em> in January 2005 reported that on the day Hossain was abducted, he was forced onto a boat and shot. His body was dumped into the river and was never been found, the report said.<br />
 <br />
 Bangladesh's southwestern Khulna District is a notoriously dangerous place for the press; underground political groups and criminal gangs routinely threaten, attack, and murder journalists in retaliation for their reporting. Between 2000 and 2005, seven journalists were murdered in the southwest.<br />

 <br />
 According to sources in Jenin, residents had gone into the city center on July 11 after Israeli forces lifted a curfew that had been in effect since June 21. Abu Zahra's colleague Said Dahla, a photographer for the official Palestinian news agency WAFA, told CPJ that at around 2 p.m., the sound of tanks coming toward the area led residents to flee or take cover inside nearby businesses or residences.<br />
 <br />
 Together, Dahla and Abu Zahra went into the middle of Faisal Street to photograph an Israeli armored personnel carrier (APC) that had slammed into an electricity pole there. Dahla said that he and Abu Zahra were alone in the street at this point facing two Israeli tanks (near the APC), which he estimated to be about 40 meters (45 yards) in front of them.<br />
 <br />
 Both men were holding cameras, according to Dahla, and Dahla wore a flak jacket clearly marked ""Press."" Dahla said that Abu Zahra also wore a cloth vest that identified him as a member of the press.<br />
 <br />
 According to Dahla, moments after the two began taking photographs, gunfire erupted from the tanks. Dahla, who was hit in the leg with bullet shrapnel, said that he looked over and saw that Abu Zahra had been injured in his thigh and was bleeding profusely.<br />
 <br />
 Dahla said that as they tried to take shelter in a nearby building, the tanks continued to fire on them. Dahla told CPJ that the two journalists remained in the building entrance, unable to get to a hospital. He estimates that more than 25 minutes passed before Abu Zahra was helped into a taxi and taken to Jenin Hospital, where he died on July 12.<br />
 <br />
 According to an Israeli army spokesperson, after the APC hit the electricity pole on the afternoon of July 11, a mob attacked the personnel carrier with Molotov cocktails and rocks, and people in the crowd fired on the tanks. The spokesperson said the soldiers in the tanks responded by firing back at the source of the gunfire.<br />
 <br />
 However, witnesses who were at the city center at the time told CPJ that residents did not attack the tanks until after the two journalists had been shot. Photos of the stranded APC taken by Dahla before the shooting show no signs of clashes or hostile action near the carrier. Moreover, there were no other reports of people injured by gunfire in Jenin that day.",,,,,2002,IS,IL,.il,Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory,israel-and-the-occupied-palestinian-territory,Middle East,mideast,mideast,Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory,Confirmed

 Brandão, owner, publisher, and columnist of the daily <em>Folha do Estado</em>, based in the city of Cuiabá in the central-western state of Mato Grosso, was shot at least five times by two unidentified men on a motorcycle.<br />
 <br />
 The two men were waiting for Brandão near the paper's new offices, which were under construction. As Brandão was surveying the exterior of the building with an engineer from the construction company, the gunmen approached him, shot him in the chest and head, and fled on the motorcycle. Several people witnessed the murder.<br />
 <br />
 In an October 1, 2002, editorial, <em>Folha do Estado</em> blamed the murder on a ""parallel power,"" a reference to organized crime groups that it said had taken over Mato Grosso. The paper attributed Brandão's death to its extensive coverage of drug trafficking, illegal gambling, and government corruption. Brandão had not received any threats, the newspaper said.<br />
 <br />
 On October 2, 2002, police arrested former police officers Hércules de Araújo Agostinho and Célio Alves de Souza in connection with the murder of Brandão. During a raid of the suspects' homes the same day, police confiscated weapons, ammunition, and four motorcycles. Two days later, police announced that ballistic tests confirmed one of the weapons found was used in Brandão's murder.<br />
 <br />
 In early December 2002, a federal judge ordered that former police officer-turned-businessman João Arcanjo Ribeiro be held in temporary detention after federal and state prosecutors identified him as the head of a major organized crime group and linked him to several homicides, including the murder of Brandão. Ribeiro fled, and was arrested in Uruguay in 2003 and held in detention there while awaiting extradition proceedings.<br />
 <br />
 Later that month, Ribeiro was formally charged with masterminding Brandão's murder in retaliation for his newspaper's criticism of organized crime and illegal gambling. Ribeiro also faced homicide, smuggling, money laundering, tax evasion, illegal gambling, and racketeering charges. Prosecutors also charged former police officers Araújo and Alves with involvement in the murder. Two suspects arrested the same month, João Leite and Fernando Barbosa Belo, were charged as accomplices.<br />
 <br />
 In December 2003, Araújo was convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison. In June 2005, Leite and Alves were convicted and sentenced to 15 and 17 years in prison, respectively. Alves escaped prison in July 2005 and remains a fugitive. In September 2005, Barbosa was convicted and sentenced to 13 years in prison.<div><br />

Alliance (NAFA), which is based in Srinagar, the summer capital of
Jammu and Kashmir State, was shot dead by an unidentified gunman.<br />
<br />
Two men entered Sultan's office at around 5:30 p.m., according to news
reports. After a brief conversation with Sultan, one of the men shot
him in the head. The Associated Press (AP) reported that the killer
used a pistol with a silencer. No one stopped the assailants from
leaving the premises, which is located in the press enclave in central
Srinagar.<br />
<br />
Though Sultan was rushed to the hospital, doctors declared the
journalist dead within minutes of his arrival, police told the AP.<br />
<br />
Sultan, 36, was known as an independent journalist who had worked for
several local Urdu-language dailies during his career. In addition to
running NAFA, he contributed investigative stories and columns to the
Urdu-language newspaper <em>Chattan</em>, one of the oldest newspapers in Kashmir.<br />
<br />
Journalists working in the disputed territory of Kashmir, which both
India and Pakistan claim, have long been vulnerable to attack by
various parties to the conflict. Sultan's colleagues told CPJ that
though they were not aware of any specific threats against the
journalist, wire service agencies such as NAFA are under constant
pressure to carry statements issued by competing political and militant
groups.<br />
<br />
Police blamed the murder on militant groups but have not yet conducted
a thorough investigation. No group claimed responsibility for Sultan's
murder, and many of the leading militant organizations, including
Hezb-ul Mujahedeen, condemned the murder, as did the All Parties

Two men were waiting for him there and fled on a motorcycle after the attack, said an Arauca Department police spokesperson.<br />
<br />
The journalist, who had been threatened previously by members of a right-wing paramilitary army, was also a freelance reporter for Colombia's most widely read daily, <em>El Tiempo</em>.<br />
<br />
In June 2002, presumed paramilitary gunmen shot and killed the owner of Radio Meridiano-70, Efraín Varela Noriega. Varela had alerted listeners to the presence of paramilitary fighters in the region days before he was assassinated.<br />
<br />
Alfonso co-hosted several news shows broadcast during the day. Since October, he had been covering armed conflict in Arauca Department as a freelance reporter for <em>El Tiempo</em>, said Álvaro Sierra, an editor at the daily. The conflict, which pits leftist rebels against rival paramilitary combatants and the government, is almost 40 years old.<br />
<br />
Alfonso lambasted all sides of the conflict but was particularly critical of the paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), said Miguel Ángel Rojas, who worked with Alfonso at Radio Meridiano-70. Rojas said Alfonso frequently reported in great detail on paramilitary activity in the region. ""He didn't hold back at all,"" said Rojas. ""I think that's what compromised him.""<br />
<br />
Fearing for his life, Alfonso fled for the capital, Bogotá, soon after Varela was killed, said Jorge Enrique Meléndez, an <em>El Tiempo</em> reporter and a friend of Alfonso's who spoke to him hours before he was killed.<br />
<br />
In Bogotá, Alfonso received about US$320 from a government protection program for journalists to help support him while he sought refuge. Alfonso returned to Arauca six weeks later.<br />
<br />
In November 2002, Alfonso's name was one of about 100 that appeared on a list distributed in the town of Arauca by paramilitary fighters, who threatened to kill the people on the list unless they ""reformed,"" said Meléndez. In the weeks before his death, however, Alfonso had told friends and colleagues that he no longer feared for his life.<p></p><p>In December 2009, Colombian prosecutors <a href=""http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/7503-paramilitary-detained-in-reporters-death.html"">ordered</a> the

Moran, a freelance cameraman on assignment for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), was killed in a suicide bombing when a man detonated a car at a checkpoint in northeastern Iraq. Another Australian journalist, ABC correspondent Eric Campbell, was injured in the incident.<br />
<br />
Michael Ware, <em>Time</em> magazine's northern Iraq correspondent and a witness to the incident, told his editor, Howard Chua-Eoan, that several foreign journalists were standing outside a checkpoint on the edge of Gerdigo, a town in northern Iraq near Halabja, interviewing people who were leaving the town in the wake of a U.S. cruise missile bombardment that began on March 21 and continued until the next day.<br />
<br />
U.S. missiles were targeting strongholds of Ansar al-Islam, a militant group that the United States designates as a terrorist organization. The area where the journalists were conducting interviews was reportedly under the control of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), a rival of Ansar al-Islam that had just taken over the area.<br />
<br />
At around 3 p.m., a taxi drove to the checkpoint near PUK soldiers and Moran, and the driver then detonated his vehicle. Most of the other journalists had just left the scene. Moran, who was filming at the time, was standing only a few feet from the checkpoint and was killed immediately. Campbell was injured by shrapnel.<br />
<br />
Chua-Eoan said it appeared that the bomber was targeting the PUK soldiers, not the journalists. According to The Associated Press, at least four other people were killed in the bombing. Militants from Ansar al-Islam are believed to be responsible for the attack.<br />
<br />
Chua-Eoan told CPJ that foreign journalists in northern Iraq had recently received warnings from U.S. State Department and Kurdish intelligence officials that Ansar al-Islam may target members of the media, as well as the hotel where most journalists are staying, the Sulaymaniyeh Palace.",,,,,2003,IZ,IQ,.iq,Iraq,iraq,Middle East,mideast,mideast,Iraq,Confirmed

Lloyd, a veteran correspondent with ITV News, was confirmed dead on March 23 by the British TV network ITN, which produces ITV News. The previous day, he had disappeared after coming under fire while driving to the southern Iraqi city of Basra.<br />
<br />
Two others disappeared with Lloyd, cameraman Fred Nerac and translator Hussein Othman. They remain missing.<br />
<br />
The three men, along with cameraman Daniel Demoustier, were traveling in two marked press vehicles in the town of Iman Anas, near Al-Zubayr, when they came under fire, ITN reported. According to Demoustier, the car he and Lloyd had been driving had been pursued by Iraqi troops who may have been attempting to surrender to the journalists. Demoustier reported that the incoming fire to their vehicles likely came from U.S. or British forces in the area.<br />
<br />
Demoustier, who was injured when the car he was driving crashed into a ditch and caught fire, managed to escape. He said he did not see what happened to Lloyd, who was seated next to him, or to the other crew members. Lloyd's body was recovered in a hospital in Basra days later.<br />
<br />
An investigative article published in <em>The</em> <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in May indicated that Lloyd's SUV and another vehicle belonging to his colleagues came under fire from U.S. Marines. The article cited accounts from U.S. troops who recalled opening fire on cars marked ""TV."" Soldiers also said they believed that Iraqi suicide bombers were using the cars to attack U.S. troops.<br />
<br />
The <em>Journal</em> article cited a report from a British security firm commissioned by ITN to investigate the incident saying that Lloyd's car was hit by both coalition and Iraqi fire;the latter most likely came from behind the car, possibly after the vehicle had crashed.<br />
<br />
The report concluded that ""[t]he Iraqis no doubt mounted an attack using the ITN crew as cover, or perhaps stumbled into the U.S. forces whilst attempting to detain the ITN crew."" The report also speculated that the missing men-Nerac and Othman, who were last seen by Demoustier in another car being stopped by Iraqi forces-might have been pulled out of their car before it came under fire from coalition forces, and then Iraqi forces used the SUV to attack the coalition forces.<br />
<br />
In April, Nerac's wife approached U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell at a NATO press conference, and he promised to do everything in his power to find out what had happened to the missing men. In late May, Centcom said that it was investigating the incident, while the British Ministry of Defense promised to open an inquiry. Neither had made public any results as of October.<br />
<br />
In September, London's <em>The Daily Mirror</em> newspaper reported the testimony of an Iraqi man named Hamid Aglan who had allegedly tried to rescue the wounded Lloyd in a civilian minibus. Aglan told the newspaper that he had picked up a lightly wounded Lloyd, who had suffered only a shoulder injury, and attempted to take him to a hospital in Basra when the minibus came under fire from a U.S. helicopter, killing Lloyd. The paper reported that the bus was also carrying wounded Iraqi soldiers.<br />
<br />
An ITN spokesperson told CPJ that a number of elements of Aglan's story are not consistent with ITN's own investigation. She said an autopsy revealed that Lloyd had suffered two serious wounds that likely resulted from Iraqi and U.S. fire. She said that after he was wounded, an Iraqi civilian in a minibus had picked up Lloyd and tried to take him to a hospital in Basra. The minibus later came under U.S. attack. ""It was a gunshot to the bus and [Terry] was probably in the bus,"" she said.

with members of the right-wing paramilitary group United Self-Defense Forces of

January 15, 2009, the court sentenced Ardila to 28 years and eight months in
prison on charges of aggravated murder and conspiracy, according to a statement
issued by the attorney general's office. Former public works officials Fabio
Pajón Lizcano and Abelardo Rueda Tobón were sentenced to 26 years and eight
months in prison apiece on aggravated murder charges. Ardila was also fined
1,192 million pesos (US$531,000).</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">In a statement, the attorney general's office said Rivas was
murdered in retaliation for his reports on official corruption and links
between Ardila's administration and right-wing paramilitary groups. A fourth
defendant, Juan Pablo Ariza Castañeda, was acquitted.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Ardila, Pajón, and Lizcano had faced allegations in the case
as early as September 2003, according to CPJ research. In 2007, the human
rights unit of the attorney general's office restarted the investigation after
a demobilized paramilitary fighter Pablo Emilio Quintero Dodino confessed to
shooting Rivas at the behest of the local officials.</p>

Couso, a cameraman for the Spanish television station Telecinco, died after a U.S. tank fired a shell at the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad, Iraq's capital, where most journalists in the city were based during the war. At around 12 p.m., a shell hit two hotel balconies where several journalists were monitoring a battle in the vicinity. Taras Protsyuk, a Ukrainian cameraman for Reuters, was also killed in the attack<br />
<br />
Agence France-Presse reported that Couso was hit in his jaw and right leg. He was taken to Saint Raphael Hospital, where he died during surgery. Couso was married with two children.<br />
<br />
Directly after the attack, Maj. Gen. Buford Blount, commander of the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division, confirmed that a single shell had been fired at the hotel from a tank in response to what he said was rocket and small arms fire from the building. Journalists at the hotel deny that any gunfire had emanated from the building.<br />
<br />
A CPJ report concluded that the shelling of the hotel, while not deliberate, was avoidable since U.S. commanders knew that journalists were present in the hotel and were intent on not hitting it. The report called on the Pentagon to conduct a thorough and public investigation into the incident.<br />
<br />
On August 12, U.S. Central Command (Centcom) issued a news release summarizing the results of its investigation into the incident. The report concluded that the tank unit that opened fire on the hotel did so ""in a proportionate and justifiably measured response."" It called the shelling ""fully in accordance with the Rules of Engagement.""<br />
<br />
Centcom offered some detail-consistent with CPJ's investigation-that the tank opened fire at what it believed was an Iraqi ""spotter"" directing enemy fire at U.S. troops. The release also explained that ""one 120mm tank round was fired at the suspected enemy observer position. ... It was only some time after the incident that A Company became aware of the fact that the building they fired on was the Palestine Hotel and that journalists at the hotel had been killed or injured as a result.""<br />
<br />
However, the news release failed to address one of the conclusions in CPJ's report: That U.S. commanders knew that journalists were in the Palestine Hotel but failed to convey this knowledge to forces on the ground.<br />
<br />
Centcom's results, which were summarized in the release, appeared to back away from earlier charges by U.S. military officials that the tank unit was responding to hostile fire emanating from the hotel. Yet, despite considerable testimony to the contrary from several journalists in the hotel, Centcom maintains ""that the enemy used portions of the hotel as a base of operations and that heavy enemy activity was occurring in those areas in and immediately around the hotel.""<br />
<br />
In addition, the news release failed to provide other specific information, such as how the decision to target the hotel was made.<br />

<br />
However, the news release failed to address one of the conclusions in CPJ's report: That U.S. commanders knew that journalists were in the Palestine Hotel but failed to convey this knowledge to forces on the ground.<br />
<br />
Centcom's results, which were summarized in the release, appeared to back away from earlier charges by U.S. military officials that the tank unit was responding to hostile fire emanating from the hotel. Yet, despite considerable testimony to the contrary from several journalists in the hotel, Centcom maintains ""that the enemy used portions of the hotel as a base of operations and that heavy enemy activity was occurring in those areas in and immediately around the hotel.""<br />
<br />
In addition, the news release failed to provide other specific information, such as how the decision to target the hotel was made.<br />

channel Al-Jazeera, was killed when a U.S. missile struck the station's
Baghdad bureau, which was located in a two-story villa in a residential
area near the Iraqi Information Ministry and the former presidential
palace compound of Saddam Hussein. Al-Jazeera cameraman Zouhair Nadhim,
who was outside on the building's roof with Ayyoub, was injured in the
blast, which targeted a small electric generator outside the building.<br />
<br />
Centcom maintains that U.S. forces were responding to enemy fire in the
area and that the Al-Jazeera journalists were caught in the crossfire.
Al-Jazeera correspondents deny that any fire came from their building.<br />
<br />
The attack occurred during heavy fighting around the bureau in an area
that housed government buildings targeted by U.S. and coalition forces.
Al-Jazeera officials pointed out that the U.S. military had been given
the bureau's exact coordinates weeks before the war began.<br />
<br />
In an April 8 letter to U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, CPJ
protested the bombing and called for an immediate investigation. In
October, a Centcom spokesman confirmed to CPJ that no investigation
into the incident has been conducted.<br />
<br />
The incident occurred around dawn, after intense anti-aircraft fire
began in the area. Talk show host and producer Maher Abdullah, a
five-year Al-Jazeera veteran who had been in Baghdad for two weeks at
the time, told CPJ that planes began flying low in the area at around 6
a.m.<br />
<br />
The crew went up to the roof of the building to report but retreated
because they deemed it unsafe. According to Abdullah, the crew realized
moments later that their still camera had been knocked out of position
and now faced the Ministry of Information building, which Iraqi
authorities had explicitly warned the crew not to film. Assistant
cameraman Zoheir Nadhim returned to the roof with Ayyoub to adjust the
camera.<br />
<br />
When Ayyoub and Nadhim went up stairs, Abdullah heard a plane fly so
low it that sounded like it was going to crash into the building. At
that point, a missile struck Al-Jazeera's small generator, which was
located outside the building at ground level just below where Ayyoub
was believed to have been at the time. Two Al-Jazeera correspondents
said that while they suspect that the strike caused his death, he could
have been killed by other ordnance.<br />
<br />
Another plane passed low about 15 minutes later and fired another
missile, which struck across the road about 50 feet (15 meters) from
the front door, blowing it off the hinges, according to Abdullah.<br />
<br />
Raed Khattar, a cameraman for Abu Dhabi TV who, at the time, was
outside on the nearby roof of Abu Dhabi TV's office, saw what was
likely the first missile because his office was between the plane and
Al-Jazeera's office, he told CPJ.<br />
<strong><br /></strong>Moments later, Abu Dhabi TV staff on the roof came
under machine gun fire from a U.S. tank on the nearby Jumhuriyya
Bridge, and one of their three unmanned cameras was struck by a shell,
staff told CPJ. The three-story building was marked with a large banner
labeled ""Abu Dhabi TV.""<br />
<br />
In a statement issued hours after the incident, Centcom in Doha, Qatar,
said that, ""According to commanders on the ground, Coalition forces
came under significant enemy fire from the building where the
Al-Jazeera journalists were working and consistent with the right of
self-defense, Coalition forces returned fire. Sadly an Al-Jazeera
correspondent was killed in this exchange.""<br />
<br />
Abdullah noted that until that morning anti-aircraft fire in the area
had been sporadic. Days before April 8, Abdullah saw manned Iraqi
anti-aircraft positions in the general vicinity-some 220 yards (200
meters) away on the opposite side of the generator, but not immediately
near the office. However, on April 11, he discovered one abandoned
anti-aircraft gun about 44 yards (40 meters) away from the bureau.
Journalists from Abu Dhabi TV told CPJ that Al-Jazeera's bureau was
located near a villa used by former Iraqi Information Minister Muhammad
Said Sahhaf.<br />
<br />
Just before the war, CPJ obtained a copy of the February 24, 2003,
letter that then Al-Jazeera Managing Director Mohammed Jasem al-Ali had
sent to the Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke specifying the
coordinates of the bureau.<br />
<br />
Al-Jazeera also maintains that the night before the strike, al-Ali had
received explicit assurances from U.S. State Department official Nabeel
Khoury in Doha, Qatar, that the bureau was safe and would not be
targeted. Abdullah told CPJ, ""The coordinates were actually given four
months in advance to the Pentagon, and we were assured that we would
not be hit under any circumstances. ... We would never be targeted,
that was the assurance.""<br />
<br />
In an e-mail reply to CPJ, Khoury, who said he did not recall the exact
date of his meeting with Al-Jazeera, said, ""I doubt very much that I
assured anybody's safety in a war zone."" He added that he did tell the
station ""what we had been telling all diplomats and civilians, that
whereas our troops would do their utmost not to hurt civilians, there
was no way to guarantee anyone's safety in a war zone.""<br />
<br />
In its April 8 letter to U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld CPJ
also noted that, ""The attack against Al-Jazeera is of particular
concern since the stations' offices were also hit in Kabul,
Afghanistan, in November 2001. The Pentagon asserted, without providing
additional detail, that the office was a 'known Al-Qaeda facility,' and
that the U.S. military did not know the space was being used by
Al-Jazeera.""<br />

Video footage of the incident, reviewed by CPJ, appears to corroborate their accounts.<br />
<br />
The shooting occurred after clashes erupted in Nablus when Israeli forces entered the city's downtown area in tanks, searching for an alleged Palestinian suicide bomber. Clashes broke out in several locations near the city's center, involving youths throwing stones and Molotov cocktails at Israeli troops. Some Palestinian gunmen were also observed firing guns, according to press accounts.<br />
<br />
At the time that Darwazeh was shot, he had been filming an Israeli tank stranded at the corner of an alleyway. Darwazeh and several other Palestinian journalists were standing by a door in the alleyway. A few minutes before Darwazeh was killed, Reuters cameraman Hassan Titi filmed a group of Palestinian youths running down the alley away from the stranded tank. Titi and Reuters photographer Abed Qusini, who were standing near Darwazeh, said that an Israeli soldier crouched under the tank and quickly fired a single shot at the journalists from a distance of about 11 to 22 yards (10 or 20 meters). Darwazeh was struck in the back of the head and died instantly.<br />
<br />
Titi and Qusini said there were no clashes or gunfire in the alley at the time, although there had been some Palestinian gunfire in the vicinity earlier. The AP reported that gunfire may have struck near the tank at around the same time, but that it likely came from a different direction from where Darwazeh was standing.<br />
<br />
Maj. Sharon Feingold, a spokeswoman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), was quoted by the AP as saying that Israeli troops had been rescuing the stranded tank when they were attacked with stones, and ""explosive devices and shots were fired from the crowd."" Despite eyewitness accounts and video footage, the IDF said that it was unclear who fired the shot that killed Darwazeh.<br />
<br />
Darwazeh and his colleagues were clearly identified as members of the press, based on the testimony of those at the scene and the video footage of the events. In fact, Darwazeh was wearing a fluorescent jacket marked press, and before the shooting, the journalists said they shouted loudly in both English and Hebrew indicating that they were with the media. <br />

Bravo died while he was being driven to a local hospital, state police chief Col. Jairo Rolando Delgado said.<br />
<br />
The journalist was shot once in the head and twice in the neck. The gunman escaped on the back of a motorcycle driven by another unknown individual. As of December, authorities had not made any arrests in the case, according to Delgado.<br />
<br />
Bravo, who directed the morning television program ""Hechos y cifras"" (Facts and Figures) for Alpevisión, had frequently accused municipal and departmental government officials of mishandling public funds. Bravo also published an occasional newsletter focused on economics and finance called <em>Eco Impacto</em> (Eco Impact).<br />
<br />
Authorities, who believe that Bravo may have been assassinated for denouncing public officials on his program, are investigating reports that he was killed by a professional assassin hired by government officials, said Pedro Moreno, director of intelligence for the Administrative Department for Security in Huila. Moreno declined to give more details.<br />
<br />
According to a friend of Bravo's, two weeks before he was killed, a man approached the journalist at his house and warned him to leave town. The man told Bravo that he had been paid 2 million Colombian pesos (US$700) to kill him. Authorities have not been able to confirm the report.<br />
<br />
Known for his investigative reporting, Bravo won Colombia's Simón Bolívar National Journalism Award in 1979. Ricardo Areiza, editor-in-chief of the Neiva-based daily <em>Diario del Huila</em>, said that Bravo had received death threats a month before his murder. ""He said that he was going to be killed, and I believe that his assassination is related to his work,"" Areiza added.<br />
<br />

Rengifo, a 48-year-old host for Radio Olímpica, was shot dead at around 6 a.m. by an unidentified gunman in the hallway of a hotel where the journalist lived in the northern town of Maicao, La Guajira Department, authorities reported.<br />
<br />
The journalist was shot five times in the back while he was walking to his room at Hotel Venecia after drinking a cup of coffee in the lobby. The gunman, who had checked into the hotel under a false name the day before, fled on a motorcycle, said state police chief Col. Heriberto Naranjo.<br />
<br />Officials investigated reports that Rengifo was killed for comments made during his weekly morning program on Radio Olímpica, ""Periodistas en acción"" (Journalists in action).&nbsp;Rengifo frequently criticized state security forces for failing to bring security to the region and also accused local politicians of corruption, said James Vargas, the station's production director. Leftist guerrillas and rival right-wing paramilitary forces fighting in the country's decades-long civil conflict all operate in the lawless region.<br />
<br />
Vargas said Rengifo had received death threats in the past. A month before the journalist was killed, someone scrawled the message ""Death to Jaime Rengifo"" on the side of a building in Maicao.

Frostbite Films, was fatally shot in the Gaza Strip. An award-winning
documentary filmmaker, the journalist was with a crew in the town of
Rafah in southern Gaza near the Egyptian border filming an HBO
documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That evening, he and
his four-person crew were in a Palestinian home filming the army's
demolition of houses in the area that the Israeli army alleged
contained tunnels used to smuggle arms.<br />
<br />
According to published testimonies of eyewitnesses and an Associated
Press Television News cameraman who was filming in the same house, the
incident occurred between 11 p.m. and 11:30 p.m., when the group
decided to leave. Miller, his producer Saira Shah, and translator Abdul
Rahman Abdullah attempted to identify themselves to the Israeli troops
in the area while they were leaving. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
troops were in armored personnel carriers (APCs) about 330 feet (100
meters) away from the house where the journalists had been filming.<br />
<br />
The journalists were wearing jackets and helmets marked ""TV."" Abdullah
waved a white flag while Miller used a flashlight to illuminate the
flag. As they approached the APCs, the journalists shouted ""Hello,"" and
then a shot was fired. The journalists yelled that they were British
journalists, and a second shot was fired immediately after. In video
footage of the incident, it appears that that the second shot hit
Miller, who was struck in the neck. Several more shots followed.<br />
<br />
An Israeli army spokesman was quoted as saying that troops in the area
returned fire after being fired on by rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs).
Later, the army said that Miller was struck by a bullet from behind,
claiming that he may have been hit by Palestinian fire.<br />
<br />
A detailed onsite investigation sponsored by Miller's colleagues,
friends, and family and conducted by British security consultant Chris
Cobb-Smith of Chiron Resources Limited security company (<a href=""http://www.chiron-resources.com/"">www.chiron-resources.com</a>)
concluded that Miller and his crew ""were consciously and deliberately
targeted by the IDF soldiers."" The report added that it is not clear
""whether this action is a deliberate policy by the IDF or whether this
incident is a result of ill discipline and malicious intent by the
junior soldiers."" A copy of the investigation is available at a Web
site hosted by James Miller's family, <a href=""http://www.justice4jamesmiller.com"">www.justice4jamesmiller.com</a>.<br />
<br />
According to the investigation, the area where Miller's crew was
operating was quiet for about an hour before he was killed. Prior to
that time, witnesses heard only sporadic gunfire, but not in the
journalists' vicinity. The report concluded that the IDF must have
known that the journalists were in the area.<br />
<br />
After viewing the video taken of the incident, Cobb-Smith discounted
the IDF's claim that RPG fire had occurred before the troops opened
fire on the journalists and observed that the shots were fired without
warning. Based on the trajectory of the bullets fired, as well as the
unanimous testimony of eyewitnesses who said the fire came from the
direction of the APC's, Cobb-Smith also disagrees with suggestions from
Israeli officials that the shots came from behind the crew.<br />

<br />
Shchekochikhin's relatives and colleagues believe the journalist was poisoned to prevent him from further uncovering the truth about a high-level corruption case involving officials from the Federal Security Services (FSB) and the Prosecutor General's Office. Based on the circumstances and secrecy surrounding Shchekochikhin's death, and the dangerous subject he was investigating at the time, CPJ also believes there is sufficient reason for launching a murder probe. The Prosecutor General's Office has repeatedly denied <em>Novaya Gazeta</em>'s requests to open a murder investigation into Shchekochikhin's death, citing lack of foul play evidence.<br />
<br />
Shchekochikhin worked for <em>Novaya Gazeta</em> since 1996, covering dangerous assignments such as the Chechen conflict, high-powered corruption, arms trade, and organized crime. From 2001 until his sudden death in 2003, he had published a series of detailed investigative reports on a smuggling and corruption case that involved a Moscow furniture store known as Tri Kita (Three Whales). As a member of Russia's parliament, Shchekochikhin interviewed officials and gained access to documents related to the case.<br />
<br />
While the Tri Kita case seemed like a regular business fraud case- the store had smuggled European furniture without paying taxes and customs fees-it involved high-ranking FSB officials who were found to have used the furniture business to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through the Bank of New York in the late '90s.<br />
<br />
In a February 18, 2002, lengthy article for <em>Novaya</em> <em>Gazeta</em>, Shchekochikhin revealed evidence that the Prosecutor General's Office had received US$2 million in bribes in order to stop a Tri Kita corruption investigation.<br />
<br />
Following its publication, Shchekochikhin received threats but continued investigating. In March 2002, as deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on Security, he helped launch a parliamentary probe into the Tri Kita case. The probe was rejected by then Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov who refused to re-open the Tri Kita case, citing lack of evidence of criminal activity.<br />

In April 2002 Shchekochikhin wrote President Vladimir Putin to request he take the case under his personal control. President Putin responded positively, but as of June 2003 the case had gone nowhere. On June 2, 2003, Shchekochikhin published another detailed article on the Tri Kita affair-his last one. Exactly a month after the material appeared in <em>Novaya Gazeta</em>, Shchekochikhin was dead.<br />
<br />
The June 2 piece criticized the corruption in Russia's law enforcement. The piece followed up the May 27, 2003, assassination of a key witness in the Tri Kita case. The witness, Sergei Pereverzev, then president of Russia's Furniture Business Association and a former navy captain, had received threats ahead of his court testimony and had publicly said he feared for his life, Shcheckochikhin wrote. On May 14, Pereverzev was injured in a car crash and taken to a Moscow military hospital. Thirteen days later, he was assassinated by a gunman who had somehow managed to penetrate the heavily guarded neurosurgical ward.<br />
<br />
Exactly one month after the piece was published, Shchekochikhin was dead-victim of an ""unknown allergen"" that caused organs failure.<br />
<br />
On June 17, 2003, while on a business trip in the city of Ryazan, 200 kilometers (120 miles) south-east of Moscow, Shchekochikhin suddenly felt sick with flu-like symptoms. He returned to Moscow that day with a fever, sore throat, body aches, and a burning sensation all over his skin, <em>Novaya Gazeta</em> reported. The next day, a doctor diagnosed him with an acute respiratory viral infection. But Shchekochikhin's health rapidly deteriorated in the next few days and he was hospitalized on June 21. In the next 12 days, the journalist's organs failed one by one-his skin literally peeled off his body; he lost all of his hair; his lungs, liver, kidneys, and, finally, his brain stopped functioning.<br />
<br />
Doctors said Shchekochikhin's symptoms were consistent with the Lyell's Syndrome-a severe allergic reaction to medications or infections, <em>Novaya Gazeta</em> said. But the allergen that caused the reaction was never identified. Moreover, Shchekochikhin's clinical test results were classified as ""medical secret."" Moscow Central Clinical Hospital authorities have refused family and colleagues access to those.<br />
<br />
Without clinical test results, the Prosecutor General's Office says there is no evidence of foul play and refuses to open a murder case into Shchekochikhin's death. Medical authorities, in turn, say they can only grant access to Shchekochikhin's file if prosecutors need to use it as evidence in a criminal investigation, according to a <em>Novaya Gazeta</em> article from January 15, 2007.<br />
<br />
A month before his death, Shchekochikhin had met with officials from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), and had obtained an American visa. He was to travel to the United States to discuss the Bank of New York, money-laundering, connection in the Tri Kita case, according to local and international press reports.

Kazemi, a contributor to the Montreal-based magazine <em>Recto Verso</em> and the London-based photo agency Camera Press, was detained on June 23 while taking photographs of the families of detainees outside Tehran's Evin Prison. She was held for nearly two weeks before being transferred to the hospital in a coma.<br />
<br />
During subsequent weeks, officials tried to cover up the circumstances of Kazemi's death. Initially, Iranian officials maintained that the journalist had died of a stroke, and that she had complained of poor health while she was detained. On July 16, Iranian Vice President Mohammad Ali Abtahi announced that Kazemi had died from a ""brain hemorrhage resulting from beatings."" Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi later backed away from the statement, saying the journalist may have died from an ""accident."" A government inquiry released in late July 2003 concluded that Kazemi died as a result of a skull fracture likely caused by a blow to her head.<br />
<br />
Authorities prevented an autopsy by burying Kazemi's body in Iran against the wishes of her family in Canada. The Canadian government responded by withdrawing its ambassador to Tehran. In the ensuing months, several agents from the Intelligence Ministry were arrested in connection with Kazemi's death.<br />
<br />
A parliamentary commission report released in November 2003 said that members of the Iranian judiciary had been holding Kazemi in custody when she was beaten, making it unlikely, according to journalists and reformist politicians, that those responsible for her death will be brought to justice.<br />
<br />
On July 24, 2004, an Iranian court acquitted intelligence agent Mohamed Reza Aqdam Ahmadi of the ""semi-intentional murder"" of Kazemi. The court cited insufficient evidence.<br />
<br />
The trial, which began on July 17, was abruptly ended the following day. Kazemi's legal team, headed by Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi, accused the court of refusing to hear witness testimony and to consider evidence accusing another prison official of delivering the fatal blow that killed Kazemi.<br />

The 36-year-old photographer, who was known professionally as La Costa, and <em>Época</em> reporter Alexandre Mansur were covering the occupation by homeless families of an empty lot belonging to a Volkswagen auto factory in São Bernardo do Campo. The homeless families, who numbered in the thousands and had been organized by the Movement of Homeless Workers (MTST), had been camping at the site since July 19 to demand housing and jobs from the state and federal governments.<br />
<br />
At around 3 p.m., while MTST leaders were talking to the journalists, three men who had just robbed a nearby gas station entered the campsite brandishing handguns. One of them shot da Costa in the chest at close range. The journalist was then taken to the São Bernardo Municipal Hospital but died shortly after.<br />
<br />
Based on eyewitness testimony and several pictures taken at the scene of the shooting by photographer André Porto, of the newspaper <em>Agora São Paulo</em>, police were able to identify da Costa's suspected attackers, two of whom were captured on July 30.<br />

The same day, police announced that one of the suspects had confessed to shooting da Costa accidentally while aiming at his camera, <em>Época</em> reported.

temporarily barring former dictator Efraín Ríos Montt from running for

by machine gun fire from a U.S. tank near the capital, Baghdad. Dana
was struck in the torso while filming near Abu Ghraib Prison, outside
Baghdad, in the afternoon. He had been reporting with a colleague near
the prison after a mortar attack had killed six Iraqis there the
previous night. The soldier in the tank who fired on Dana did so
without warning, while the journalist filmed the vehicle approaching
him from about 55 yards (50 meters).<br />
<br />
U.S. military officials said the soldier who opened fire mistook Dana's
camera for a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launcher. There was no
fighting taking place in the area, and the journalists had been
operating in the vicinity of the prison with the knowledge of U.S.
troops near the prison gates.<br />
<br />
In an August 18 letter to U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld,
CPJ protested the shooting, stating that it raised ""serious questions
about the conduct of U.S. troops and their rules of engagement.""<br />
<br />
On September 22, the U.S. military announced that it had concluded its
investigation into the incident. A spokesman for U.S. Central Command
(Centcom) in Iraq told CPJ that while Dana's killing was ""regrettable,""
the soldier ""acted within the rules of engagement."" No further details
were provided. The results of the investigation have not been made
public. A Centcom spokesman said other details of the report are
classified.<br />
<br />
Dana's soundman, Nael Shyioukhi, who witnessed the incident, told CPJ
that he and Dana arrived at the prison with their driver, Munzer Abbas,
in the late afternoon. According to Shyioukhi, several journalists were
also in the area. Shyioukhi said that after a short while Dana
suggested that they approach the prison gates to begin filming. At one
point, Dana identified himself to a U.S. soldier as a journalist from
Reuters and asked if a spokesman was available to comment on camera
about the attack the previous night. The soldier replied that he could
not comment, and no spokesmen were available. Dana then asked the
soldier if he and Shyioukhi could film the prison from a nearby bridge.
According to Shyioukhi, the soldier politely told them they were
welcome to do so.<br />
<br />
After filming from the bridge, located between 330 and 660 yards (300
and 600 meters) from the prison, Dana and Shyioukhi, who were wearing
jeans and T-shirts, packed their equipment in their car and began to
head off for the Reuters office. As they approached the main road to
the prison, Dana noticed a convoy of tanks approaching and told Abbas
to stop so he could film it. According to Shyioukhi, he and Dana were
not apprehensive because the area was calm, and it was apparent that
U.S. troops were in complete control. Neither Dana nor Shyioukhi were
wearing flak jackets, and their car was not marked press.<br />
<br />
Dana exited the car and set up his blue, canvas-encased camera with a
white microphone facing the tanks while Shyioukhi lit a cigarette.
Shyioukhi said Dana filmed for about 10 seconds, when suddenly, without
warning, several shots rang out from the lead tank, which was
approximately 55 yards (50 meters) away.<br />
<br />
Shyioukhi ducked for cover then heard Dana scream and place his hand on
his stomach, which was bleeding profusely. He said that within moments
of the shooting, approximately six U.S. soldiers, including the one who
shot Dana, surrounded them. Shyioukhi recounted that the soldier who
shot Dana screamed at Shyioukhi to ""stand back.""<br />
<br />
A doctor arrived on an armored personnel carrier (APC) after about 10
minutes and tried to stop the bleeding. The APC took Dana back to the
prison complex for treatment and to get him evacuated to a hospital.<br />
<br />
U.S. military spokesman Col. Guy Shields called Dana's death a ""tragic
incident"" and promised to do everything to avoid a similar incident in
the future. When questioned by London's <em>Independent</em>
about the rules of engagement for U.S. troops, Shields said, ""I can't
give you details on the rules of engagement, but the enemy is not in
formations, they are not wearing uniforms. During wartime firing a
warning shot is not a necessity. There is no time for a warning shot if
there is potential for an ambush.""<br />
<br />
Some journalists at the scene questioned how troops could mistake the
camera for a weapon. And according to experts who train war
correspondents, although one might easily mistake a camera for an RPG
launcher at a distance, a camera would be clearly visible from 55 to
110 yards (50 to 100 meters)-the distance at which Dana was hit. <strong><br /></strong>",,,,,2003,IZ,IQ,.iq,Iraq,iraq,Middle East,mideast,mideast,Iraq,Confirmed

<br />
Sidorov was the second editor-in-chief of <em>Tolyatinskoye Obozreniye</em> to be murdered in the last two years. His predecessor, Valery Ivanov, was shot at point-blank range in April 2002.<br />
<br />
According to local press reports, two unidentified assailants stabbed
Sidorov several times in the chest late in the evening while he was
approaching the apartment building in Togliatti where he lived with his
family. The assailants fled after stabbing Sidorov, and the editor died
in his wife's arms after she heard his call for help and came down to
the entrance of their building.<br />
<br />
Journalists at <em>Tolyatinskoye Obozreniye</em>-a newspaper
known for its investigative reporting on organized crime, government
corruption, and shady corporate deals in the heavily industrialized
city of Togliatti-are convinced the murder is in retaliation for
Sidorov's work.<br />
<br />
""All of our investigative work was supervised by Aleksei,"" a journalist at <em>Tolyatinskoye Obozreniye</em> told CPJ. Another journalist at the paper told CPJ that Sidorov had received unspecified threats in retaliation for his work.<br />
<br />
Government officials initially agreed that Sidorov's murder appeared to
be a contract killing in retaliation for his work. But a week after the
killing, officials began offering conflicting explanations about the
motive for the murder. On October 16, the local head of the Interior
Ministry, Vladimir Shcherbakov, said Sidorov was stabbed after refusing
to give a stranger a sip of some vodka he had supposedly been drinking,
the independent Moscow daily <em>Gazeta</em> reported.<br />
<br />
That same day, Deputy Prosecutor General Vladimir Kolesnikov said the
murder was related to ""the journalist's professional activity,"" the
independent Moscow daily <em>Kommersant</em>
reported. But the next day, he switched his story, calling the murder
""an act of hooliganism,"" the ITAR-TASS news agency reported.<br />
<br />
According to the local press reports, Samara's Deputy Prosecutor
General Yevgeny Novozhylov said that an intoxicated welder from one of
the local factories, Yevgeny Maininger, stumbled upon Sidorov that
evening and murdered him after a brief argument. Local police detained
Maininger on October 12 and charged him with murder on October 21 after
he confessed to the killing.<br />
<br />
Sidorov's family and journalists at <em>Tolyatinskoye Obozreniye</em>
were skeptical that authorities had found the true killer-and a year
later, a Russian district court judge confirmed their doubts by
acquitting Maininger.<br />
<br />
On October 11, 2004, Judge Andrei Kirillov found that the 29-year-old
Maininger was not involved in Sidorov's murder and said the
prosecution's case was untenable, the independent Moscow daily <em>Kommersant</em> reported.<br />
<br />
Sidorov's father said the family was pleased that the acquittal ended
what they considered to be a flawed investigation. ""The investigation,
instead of seeking out the real killer of my son, tried to dump
everything on this innocent person,"" said Vladimir Sidorov, according
to local press reports. ""We will do everything possible to ensure that

Chetharith, a deputy editor of the royalist FUNCINPEC party's Ta Prum radio station, was killed by a gunman riding on the back of a motorcycle while the journalist was on his way to work in the capital, Phnom Penh.<br />
<br />
According to witnesses interviewed by Agence France-Presse, Chetharith, 37, was shot in the head at point-blank range in broad daylight. Local sources tell CPJ that Ta Prum is known for its critical reporting of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, and that the station's director, Noranarith Anandayath, is an adviser to FUNCINPEC party chief Prince Norodom Ranaridhh.<br />
<br />
The day before the shooting, the prime minister criticized Ta Prum in the English-language <em>Cambodia Times</em>, accusing the station of insulting his leadership.<br />
<br />
Chetharith's murder came ahead of scheduled three-way talks between the FUNCINPEC party, the opposition Sam Rainsy Party, and the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP). The talks were canceled after the journalist's killing. They had been aimed at ending a political stalemate following the July 27 elections, when Hun Sen and his CPP failed to garner a two-thirds majority of the vote. By law, the CPP was required to form a coalition with opposition parties but refused to do so.<br />
<br />
In early December, Police Commissioner Heng Pov told the Cambodian Center for Human Rights (CCHR) that although police have identified possible suspects in Chetarith's murder, they do not have enough evidence to make any arrests.

Coast's commercial capital, Abidjan, was shot by a police officer in
the evening outside the national police headquarters in central Abidjan
while waiting to interview detained opposition activists who were being
released, according to local and international press reports. The
officer was arrested immediately and the Ivoirian government promised
an investigation.<br />
<br />
After Hélène's family, RFI, and the France-based press freedom group
Reporters Without Borders applied in France to become civil parties in
the case, a French public prosecutor began conducting an investigation
into the murder. Under French law, French authorities have jurisdiction
in the case because the victim was French. Although the French and
Ivoirian inquiries are legally separate, officials have been
cooperating. France and Ivory Coast have a bilateral treaty on judicial
cooperation dating back to Ivoirian independence.<br />
<br />
The day Hélène was killed, he was waiting in his car in front of the
headquarters when the officer walked over and asked what he was doing,
according to press reports. The journalist said he was waiting to talk
to opposition party members. The officer then went into the building,
came back out, and fired two shots, hitting Hélène in the head and
killing him instantly.<br />
<br />
Although the motive for the killing is unknown, the assassination
occurred against a background of anti-French sentiment since Ivory
Coast plunged into civil war and crisis in September 2002. France has
troops in the country and helped broker a peace agreement signed in
Paris in January 2003. The international-and especially French-media
have also come under attack from the local press since the crisis began.<br />
Jérome Bouvier, director of RFI's French-language services, told CPJ
that the climate for foreign journalists had been extremely difficult
but seemed to have improved in the months before the killing. ""That's
what makes it even more shocking,"" he said. "" It happened in the center
of the city, in front of an official building full of people in
uniform.""<br />
<br />
Hélène had been covering Africa for RFI for more than 10 years,
including conflicts in Rwanda and Somalia. He was known for his rigor,
independence, and calm. In one of many tributes, French President
Jacques Chirac described Hélène as ""a great professional who died doing
his job in the service of providing information about the Africa he
knew so well.""<br />

police officer Sgt. Théodore Séry Dago to 17 years in prison for
Hélène's murder. The officer was also fined 500,000 CFA francs
(US$960), stripped of his rank in the national police, and barred from
voting or leaving his home province for 10 years. The tribunal ordered

Shawkat, editor of the weekly <em>Bilah Ittijah</em> (Without Direction), was shot and killed by one or more gunmen at his office in Mosul. According to press reports, a gunman and an accomplice followed the journalist to the roof of his office in the afternoon. One local journalist told CPJ that Shawkat was on the roof making a call from his satellite telephone when he was shot.<br />
<br />
CPJ continues to investigate the case for more details, but based on current research, CPJ believes that Shawkat was killed for his work as a journalist.<br />
<br />
Sources report that Shawkat's writing often criticized Islamists, Islam, the former regime of Saddam Hussein, and the U.S-led occupation. According to one local journalist who has followed the case, Shawkat had recently written a piece that questioned whether or not Arabic was the language of heaven.<br />
<br />
Shawkat's daughter, Roaa, who also works at <em>Bilah Ittijah</em>, told CPJ in an e-mail that her father had received several verbal threats warning him to close the newspaper, as well as one written threat a few months before his death. <em>The</em> <em>Washington Post</em> reported on November 16 that Shawkat's son, Sindbad, said that the written threat accused Shawkat of being a Zionist guilty of colluding with infidels. The <em>Post</em> reported that Sindbad had warned his father not to write about foreign Islamist extremists in Iraq.<br />
<br />
According to the local journalist, Shawkat was confronted in his office a few days prior to his shooting by several men with long beards-sometimes a sign of religiosity in Muslim countries. The journalist told CPJ that a man who has an office in the same building as the paper told investigators that he saw the same bearded men fleeing the scene after Shawkat was shot. The journalist said that both local and regional police were investigating the case, but that the regional police has ended its investigations and closed the case file for lack of evidence.

According to local press reports, the cameraman's widow, Svetlana Zavadskaya, initiated the judicial process in October 2003. Zavadsky's body was never recovered following his abduction.<br />
<br />
The journalist was reported missing after he failed to keep a scheduled late-morning rendezvous on July 7, 2000, with his longtime colleague and friend Pavel Sheremet at the airport in Minsk.
</p>




Local media reported that Zavadsky had been seen inside the airport not long before Sheremet's flight arrived from Moscow. Zavadsky's car was later found locked and parked outside the airport building. A search for the journalist by local police and officials from the local prosecutor's office turned up no clues.<br />
<br />
Sheremet, a former ORT bureau chief in Minsk who now heads the station's special projects department in Moscow, had recently traveled to Chechnya with Zavadsky to shoot ""The Chechen Diary,"" a four-part documentary about the war there. CPJ sources in Belarus suspect that Zavadsky was abducted because he had footage that showed Belarusian security agents fighting alongside Chechen rebel forces.<br />
<br />
Sheremet and Zavadsky's wife told reporters that shortly after Zavadsky returned from Chechnya, he began receiving phone calls from an unknown man who insisted on a meeting.<br />
<br />
Zavadsky was President Aleksandr Lukashenko's personal cameraman until 1996. During the summer of 1997, local police detained Sheremet and Zavadsky while they were filming a documentary about smuggling between Belarus and Lithuania. They later received a suspended sentence for alleged illegal border crossing.<br />
<br />
Sheremet has repeatedly accused Belarusian intelligence agents of being involved in Zavadsky's disappearance. Although investigators have publicly rejected this theory, Sheremet claims they do not rule it out in private. The Belarusian prosecutor's office has ""cautiously hinted that former agents of the Belarus secret services, along with some of their Russian counterparts, might have been involved,"" Sheremet told the local news agency BelaPAN.<br />
<br />
Senior Belarus officials, including Acting Interior Minister Mikhail Udovikov, have hinted that Zavadsky's disappearance may have resulted from his pro-Russian coverage of the war in Chechnya. They have also suggested that the journalist was kidnapped, either by his ORT colleagues, including Sheremet, or by members of the local opposition.<br />
<br />
In addition to the threatening phone calls Zavadsky had received before his disappearance, two men were spotted trailing the journalist near his apartment building on the day he disappeared, Zavadsky's neighbors told police. The police commissioned artist sketches of the alleged stalkers but refused to release them. In early August 2000, police also collected samples of Zavadsky's hair from his family for testing without explaining the purpose of the tests.<br />
<br />
Later that month, police classified Zavadsky's disappearance as a premeditated crime and announced they had identified five suspects. The primary suspect, a leader of the Belarusian branch of the ultraright Russian National Unity movement named Valery Ignatovich, was in prison by the end of 2000. Police ruled out the theory that Belarusian security agents had been involved in the crime.<br />
<br />
On November 20, 2000, local independent media had received an unsigned e-mail from a person who identified himself as an officer of the Belarus State Security Committee involved in the Zavadsky investigation. The writer claimed that nine suspects had been arrested, seven of whom were either current or former officers of the Presidential Security Service, and that the suspects had confessed to killing Zavadsky and had named the place where his body was buried. According to the e-mail, the investigators had also found a shovel stained with Zavadsky's blood.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the e-mail claimed that President Lukashenko refused to allow investigators to exhume the body, and that the case was later transferred from the Prosecutor's Office to the Interior Ministry to sabotage the investigation.<br />
<br />
The next day, the Belarusian State Security Council denounced the allegations, while Lukashenko blamed Zavadsky's disappearance on Chechen kidnappers. At the same time, Sheremet told BelaPAN he believed that the information from the anonymous e-mailer might be trustworthy, while local sources told CPJ that they had received similar information from other anonymous sources close to the investigation.<br />
<br />
A week after the e-mail was made public, Lukashenko fired four senior aides: his adviser on security issues, the chairman of the Security Council, the prosecutor general, and the head of the State Security Committee. Lukashenko claimed that the four men had been plotting a coup and had abducted Zavadsky in an effort to compromise the president.<br />
<br />
Interior Minister Vladimir Naumov promised to resolve the case no later than January 2001. Local observers questioned the integrity of the investigation, however, given that Naumov once headed the special police unit, Almaz, some of whose members were suspected of being involved in the crime.<br />
<br />
On March 14, 2002, two former Almaz members, Valery Ignatovich and Maxim Malik, were convicted and sentenced to life in prison for abducting Zavadsky. Prosecutors argued that Ignatovich and Malik kidnapped the journalist in reprisal for an interview he had given to the Minsk-based <em>Belorusskaya Delovaya Gazeta</em> during which he alleged that certain unnamed Belarusians had fought with Chechen rebels against Russian forces.<br />
<br />
The trial was held behind closed doors in the Belarusian capital, Minsk. Journalists were only allowed into the courtroom for the reading of the sentence.<br />
<br />
Zavadsky's lawyer and family said the trial failed to examine credible allegations that Belarusian authorities were also involved in the abduction. Sergei Tsurko, a lawyer for Zavadsky's family, claims that Ignatovich and Malik are scapegoats and that real responsibility lies with the Belarusian government.<br />
<br />
On March 25, 2002, the missing cameraman's relatives filed a petition with the Belarusian Supreme Court, claiming that prosecutors had not sufficiently proven that Ignatovich and Malik were responsible for kidnapping Zavadsky. The petition urged further investigation into Zavadsky's abduction and his subsequent fate.<br />
<br />
In June 2002, two former employees of the Prosecutor General's Office, Dmitry Petrushkevich and Oleg Sluchek, who had alleged that President Lukashenko had derailed the investigation because of evidence linking a government-led death squad to Zavadsky's murder, were granted asylum in the United States.<br />
<br />
Zavadsky's colleague Pavel Sheremet and local opposition groups have supported these claims.<br />
<br />
The U.S. State Department has also publicly validated Petrushkevich and Sluchek's claims. ""We think these revelations are important,"" State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said at a June 19, 2002, press briefing.<br />
<br />
Two weeks later, on July 3, 2002, Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky and other U.S. officials met with Petrushkevich and Sluchek to discuss Zavadsky's disappearance and several other cases in which Belarusian individuals were allegedly murdered for political reasons, Agence France-Presse reported.<br />
<br />
On November 28, 2003, a district court in Minsk declared Zavadsky officially dead. Judge Nataliya Andreyeva spent several hours examining evidence presented by the Public Prosecutor's Office that the ORT cameraman had died after his abduction and then officially changed Zavadsky's status from missing to dead.<br />
<br />
""This was done for property-related reasons so that my apartment can be registered in my name,"" Zavadskaya told CPJ. ""I still want to find out the truth about my husband and what happened to him.""<br />
<br />
The Public Prosecutor's Office ended its investigation into the Zavadsky case in January 2003, claiming they had pursued all available leads in the cameraman's disappearance.<br />
<br />
On December 10, 2003, prosecutors announced they had reopened the investigation about 48 hours before the Council of Europe, a pan-Europe human rights monitoring organization, released a report alleging that high-level government officials were involved in the journalist's disappearance and its subsequent cover-up.<br />
<br />
However, Ivan Branchel, deputy head of the prosecutor's Organized Crime and Corruption Department, sent a letter to Zavadskaya in early April 2004 informing her that the case was closed on March 31, 2004, said the Minsk-based human rights group Charter 97.<br />

Aceh military spokesman Lt. Col. Firdaus Komarno told Agence France-Presse that the firefight broke out when Indonesian soldiers came across a group of rebels in the area. Siregar's body and the body of a rebel fighter were found later.<br />
<br />
According to news reports, the rebels accused the military of executing Siregar. In response, the military has claimed that the rebels were using the journalist as a human shield.<br />
<br />
Siregar, 52, was kidnapped on June 29 by rebels from the Free Aceh Movement, known by its Indonesian acronym GAM, along with cameraman Fery Santoro, their driver, and two Indonesian officers' wives who were sharing a ride with the journalists to the town of Lhokseumawe in northern Aceh. The RCTI crew had been reporting on the military offensive in Aceh, which was launched on May 19 to crush the long-running rebel insurgency. On July 3, a spokesman for the rebels announced that the group was being held on suspicion of working for the Indonesian military (TNI).<br />
<br />
GAM later dropped that accusation, but various attempts to secure the release of the hostages failed. On July 6, TNI Cmdr. Gen. Endriartono Sutarto set a deadline of July 8 for GAM to release the hostages or else face military attack. That same day, Imam Wahyudi, an editor at RCTI, and nine other journalists were allowed to meet with Siregar and reported that Siregar and Santoro were in good health. After GAM failed to meet the July 8 deadline, military officials questioned Wahyudi and the other journalists who had met with Siregar about how they were able to contact GAM and locate their base.<br />
<br />
Further negotiations between the military and the rebels stalled over the rebels' demands for a seven-day ceasefire and that the military not be involved in the transfer of the hostages. TNI rejected the demands and proposed instead the creation of a battle-free zone where the hostages could be transferred from GAM control. Meanwhile, on October 4, the <em>Jakarta Post</em> reported that Siregar was suffering from deteriorating health, including coughing up blood.<br />
<br />
On November 5, Indonesian security minister Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono ordered the military to start an operation to locate the hostages, accusing GAM of being ""a terror group which takes reporters and innocent civilians hostage.""<br />
<br />
On December 19, the driver was released unharmed.The two wives were released in February 2004. On May 16, Santoro was released and handed over to representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross.",,,,,2003,ID,ID,.id,Indonesia,indonesia,Asia,asia,asia,Indonesia,Confirmed

 <br />
 Saha, 45, a correspondent with the daily <em>New Age</em> and a contributor to the BBC's Bengali-language service, was taking a rickshaw home from the Khulna Press Club when unidentified assailants stopped his vehicle and threw a bomb at him, according to local journalists. The assailants fled the scene.<p></p>
 
 <p>Police suspect that members of the region's outlawed Maoist guerrilla 
groups may be responsible for the attack. On the day of Saha's murder, 
an underground leftist group, Janajuddha (People's War), a faction 
of the Purbo Banglar Communist Party, claimed responsibility for the 
killing in letters faxed to local news organizations. </p>

<p>A former reporter with the daily <em>Sangbad</em>, Saha had 20 years 
of journalism experience and was known for his bold reporting on the 
Khulna region's criminal gangs, drug traffickers, and Maoist insurgents, 
said local journalists. According to these sources, in recent days, 
Saha felt that he was increasingly at risk of reprisal for his reporting. 
He told colleagues that he had received several death threats that 
he suspected may have come from criminal gangs. </p>

<p>Saha, who was active in Bangladesh's press freedom community, was 
the former president of the Khulna Press Club and worked closely with 
the Bangladesh Center for Development, Journalism, and Communication, 
a local press freedom group.</p>

<p>Police charged 13 alleged Maoists insurgents with Saha's murder in 
June, although only a fraction were in custody. Local journalists 
say that those responsible for organizing the attack had not been 
arrested.</p>

<p>Two suspects, leaders of the Janajuddha faction, died in separate 
shootouts with police in late August. Authorities also accused the 
two dead suspects, Altaf Hossain and Imam Sarder, in the murder of 
Humayun Kabir, an editor from Khulna who died in a violent attack 
in June, according to local news reports. </p>

<p>The network said that Mohammed, who also worked as a translator, and 
Khatab died of multiple gunshot wounds after unidentified assailants 
fired on the two-car convoy the men were traveling in that afternoon. 
Cameraman Scott McWhinnie, who was traveling in the second vehicle, 
was grazed in the head by a bullet, CNN said, but the remaining members 
of the convoy--two CNN journalists, a security adviser, and the second 
driver--were unharmed. McWhinnie was treated at a nearby military base.</p>

<p>According to CNN, the vehicles were headed north toward Baghdad when 
a rust-colored Opel approached from behind. A single gunman with an 
AK-47, positioned through the sunroof, opened fire on one of the vehicles. 
CNN's vice president for international public relations, Nigel Pritchard, 
told CPJ that both CNN cars were unmarked, and that the attackers 
may not have been aware they were journalists.</p>

Torre had worked as a campaign chief for León, the Lima-based 
daily <i>La República</i> reported. After León won the 
elections, he appointed de la Torre head of the municipality's public

tenure as mayor, when de la Torre resigned after discovering several 
instances of alleged corruption, according to <i>La República</i>.</p>

In October 2003, Giraldo said, unidentified individuals had hurled 
a homemade bomb at the journalist's home in the middle of the night. 
The explosion did not cause major damage, and de la Torre was able 
to put out the fire. De la Torre had also received several anonymous

<p>On March 17, at the request of the Yungay Public Prosecutor's Office, 
an Ancash court ordered León and his daughter detained on charges 
of masterminding de la Torre's murder in an attempt to silence the 
journalist. According to Prosecutor Luz Marina Romero, two other municipal 
workers were charged as accomplices in the crime. The four were jailed 
in a prison in Huaraz, the capital of Ancash Department. Another man 
charged in the murder remained a fugitive.</p>

<p>In 2006, the Supreme Court reversed the court's decision, finding the
evidence circumstantial and the motive insufficient. The convicted killers were
released, and León retook office immediately.</p>",,,,,2004,PE,PE,.pe,Peru,peru,Americas,americas,americas,Peru,Confirmed

Telugu-language daily <em>Andhra Prabha</em>, was stabbed to death near 
his home in the town of Medak, in India's southern Andhra Pradesh 
State. Local journalists told CPJ that Yadagiri, 35, was murdered 
in reprisal for his articles investigating the illegal sale of home-brewed 
liquor, known locally as toddy.</p>

<p>Local sources told CPJ that Yadagiri had written a series of articles 
detailing the dangers of consuming toddy and accusing local politicians 
of being involved in its trade. The national English-language newspaper 
<em>The</em> <em>Hindu </em>reported that prior to his death, Yadagiri 
had registered a police complaint after he received threats from a 
local contractor involved in the illegal toddy business.</p>

<p>According to local sources, on the night of February 21, Yadagiri 
was invited to a meeting with several people involved in the toddy 
trade. After the meeting, Yadagiri was accompanied home by at least 
three of the men who had been present, along with Siddaram Reddy, 
another local journalist and friend of Yadagiri. Lakshminarayana Goud, 
one of those accompanying Yadagiri, stabbed him multiple times before 
fleeing the scene, according to local news reports and sources.</p>

<p>Local police arrested four suspects and charged them with involvement 
in the murder. According to Amar Devulapalli, the head of the Andhra 
Pradesh Union of Working Journalists (APUWJ), Goud was charged, along 
with Sirimalle Srinivas, Venkatesh Chauhan, and Nagi Reddy (who is 
not related to Siddaram Reddy).</p>

<p>Devulapalli told CPJ that the state government of Andhra Pradesh condemned 
the murder and gave money and land to Yadagiri's family as compensation 
for their loss. However, local police have accused Siddaram Reddy 
of being the true culprit in the murder and have arrested and charged 
him with involvement, Devulapalli said. </p>

<p>APUWJ pressured the federal Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) 
to investigate the state's prosecution of Yadagiri's murder. The CBI 
began an inquiry into the handling of the case, postponing the trials 
of all the defendants, Devulapalli said.</p>

political activist, in Peru's eastern Ucayali Department. Rivera, 54, hosted
the morning show ""Transparencia"" (Transparency), broadcast daily on Frecuencia
Oriental radio station, in the city of Pucallpa. In addition to being a
journalist, he served as president of a local journalists' association and
owned a glass store.</p>

<p>According to local
press reports, Rivera was murdered about 1:30 p.m. while he was at his office
in the glass store. Two unidentified individuals entered the store and one of
them pulled out a gun and shot Rivera twice in the chest and shoulder. There
was no sign of robbery, CPJ sources said. Rivera died of his wounds before he
could be taken to the hospital.</p>

<p>A former parliamentary
deputy for the Frente Democrático (Democratic Front), Rivera was an outspoken
and controversial radio commentator known for his sharp criticism of local and
regional authorities. On January 13, 2004, Rivera participated in a demonstration
organized by squatters against local authorities in the province of Coronel
Portillo. The protesters damaged the local council building, and then-Mayor Luis Valdez Villacorta
filed a lawsuit against some of them, including Rivera, for property damages,
CPJ sources said. Rivera had accused the mayor of corruption in the sale of
land occupied by squatters.</p>

<p>Shortly after the murder, local police
said Samuel Gonzáles Pinedo confessed to hiring his cousin Erwin Pérez Liendo
and two other men to kill Rivera, according to press accounts.</p>

<p>Gonzáles' statements
led to the arrest of two employees of the Coronel Portillo provincial
municipality, Roy Gavino Culqui Saurino and Martín Ignacio Flores. The two
worked in public relations for the provincial council. Culqui also was director
of the radio show ""La Noticia"" (The News), broadcast on Radio Super, and Flores
worked as freelance reporter. Culqui
and Flores, along with several others, were convicted in 2006 and 2007 for
planning and carrying out the murder, according to <a href=""http://www.larepublica.pe/10-05-2012/absuelven-ex-alcalde-luis-valdez-del-crimen-de-alberto-rivera"">news reports</a>.</p>

was an active member of the opposition Democratic Labor Party (PDT) and

critic of the local government, he had been particularly vocal during

police investigate several recent murders in the area. He said he had
documents proving that important local figures were involved in
organized crime, the daily <i>Correio do Estado</i> reported. Romã had

alleged financial irregularities, according to other news accounts.</p>

Romã's political and journalistic activities, local sources told CPJ. </p>

Jovanovic, the controversial publisher and editor-in-chief of the 
opposition daily <em>Dan</em> (Day), was shot in a drive-by shooting 
on the evening of May 27 while he was leaving his office in the Montenegrin 
capital, Podgorica. <p></p>

<p>Unidentified assailants shot Jovanovic in the head and chest with 
an automatic rifle as he was entering his car just after midnight. 
<em>Dan</em> is closely tied to the Socialist People's Party, which 
supported former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic throughout 
the 1990s. Jovanovic was head of the tax police in Milosevic's government 
during the 1990s. </p>

<p>In recent years, the newspaper has faced numerous lawsuits for criticizing 
Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, Jovanovic's former political ally 
from the 1990s. Both <em>Dan</em> and Jovanovic's family reported that 
the editor had received numerous death threats, and the newspaper's 
office in Podgorica was set on fire in April 2003. </p>

<p>Judge Radomir Ivanovic of the Podgorica High Court and police officers 
initiated a murder investigation, according to local press reports. 
Police said the murder was a top priority and called in German forensic 
experts to assist in examining recovered evidence, including the weapon 
and vehicle used in the killing, according to local press reports. 
</p>

<p>On June 9, police arrested Damir Mandic, a karate expert and organized 
crime figure, as a suspect. Ten days later, Ivanovic began questioning 
potential witnesses in the case. </p>

<p>In early September, the editor's wife, Slavica Jovanovic, testified 
before the court that the head of Montenegro's State Security Service 
(SDB), Dusko Markovic, had called her husband and threatened to kill 
him in April 2003, according to <em>Dan</em>. </p>

<p>A lawyer representing the Jovanovic family asked the court to call 
senior government officials--including Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, 
President Filip Vujanovic, and Markovic--for questioning, but the court 
rejected the request, the Belgrade-based news agency Beta reported. </p>

<p>On October 2, prosecutors charged Mandic with murder, citing gunpowder 
residue, a DNA analysis, and other evidence linking him to the Volkswagen 
Golf 3 vehicle used in the crime, the independent Podgorica-based 
weekly <em>Monitor</em> reported. The indictment refers to but does 
not identify other individuals who were with Mandic at the time of 
the shooting, according to local press reports. </p>

<p>While the indictment does not clarify the reason for the murder, the 
only serious motive discussed in the local press has been Jovanovic's 
work for <em>Dan</em> exposing government abuses. </p>

<p>Mandic pleaded not guilty in November, saying he was framed, The Associated 
Press reported. In
April 2009, Mandic was sentenced to 30 years in prison for being an accomplice
in Jovanovic's murder.</p>

<p>A lawyer representing the Jovanovic family and <em>Dan</em> staff has 
criticized the police investigation for failing to identify Mandic's 
accomplices; not identifying who ordered the killing; and not investigating 
possible links between Mandic and Montenegrin government authorities. </p>

<p>Journalists and human rights activists have complained about the slow 
progress of the police inquiry and have expressed concern that only 
one suspect has been identified and is being charged for the crime.

Sri Lankan army and members of the breakaway faction of Nadesan's 
murder, according to the pro-LTTE Internet news site <i>Tamil.net</i>.</p>

he had criticized the government and security forces, according to

BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner was critically injured in the attack, which left him partly paralyzed.</p>
<p>Cumbers was with Gardner, a driver, and a minder, assigned by the Saudi Ministry of Information, as he filmed a house belonging to an Al-Qaeda militant killed by Saudi police in 2003, according to news reports.</p>
<p>According to Gardner's 2006 book <i>Blood and Sand</i>, the crew originally agreed to spend no more than 10 minutes in Al-Suwaidi, given the district's reputation for its strong Al-Qaeda presence. At the time, the government minder did not express concern for the safety of the crew, so Cumbers and Gardner decided to stay for another 30 minutes to film multiple takes, Gardner wrote. As they were about to pack up and leave, a young Saudi male dressed in the traditional white <i>thobe</i> got out from his car and approached the crew. He greeted Gardner, saying in Arabic ""Peace be upon you,"" to which Gardner replied with the traditional ""And upon you the peace and mercy of God and his blessings."" The man hesitated a moment, pulled out a pistol, and began to fire.</p>
<p>Gardner wrote that he tried to run away, but was hit in the shoulder. A second round struck him in the leg and he fell to the ground in front of a second group of gunmen who were inside a minivan and had opened fire on him. One of the shooters then rifled through his pockets before the group left the scene. Gardner wrote that he lay bleeding on the ground for more than a half-hour before police drove him to a hospital.</p>
<p>In a meeting in 2005, Saudi detectives told Gardner that Cumbers died as he got into the van to try and escape, Gardner wrote in his book. News reports said Cumbers was shot in the head. The detectives said that the driver and the government minder survived.</p>
<p>The Saudi detectives told Gardner that six gunmen had undertaken the operation, according to the book. The detectives said that members of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula were headed to meet Abdulaziz al-Muqrin, the head of the group, in the Al-Suwaidi neighborhood when they spotted the TV crew. The detectives said that<b> </b>al-Muqrin gave the order to kill the journalists.</p>
<p>The detectives told Gardner that the gunman who first shot him was named Abdullah al-Subaei, but that it was Faisal al-Dakheel, a senior member of the group, who fired again at Gardner from the minivan.</p>
<p>Al-Muqrin and al-Dakheel were killed in a shootout with security forces on June 18, 2004, in Al-Suwaidi, according to <a href=""http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2004%2FWORLD%2Fmeast%2F06%2F18%2Fsaudi.kidnap%2F&amp;date=2009-10-24"">news reports</a>. At least three other expatriates were killed in the 12 days between Cumbers' murder and the shootout, according to <i>Jihad in Saudi Arabia</i>, a 2010 book written by scholar Thomas Heghammer. Three of the other assailants were also killed in clashes with security forces.</p>
<p>The sixth member of the attackers, Adel al-Dhubaiti, was arrested in 2005, Gardner told CPJ. In the 2005 meeting with Gardner, the Saudi detectives told him that al-Dhubaiti was the gunman who shot Cumbers.</p>
<p>On November 18, 2014, the Saudi Specialized Criminal Court <a href=""http://bigstory.ap.org/article/968ef59efd9a461999e3802af45f7d2e/saudi-convicts-8-attacks-killed-foreigners"">sentenced</a> al-Dhubaiti to death for his role in multiple Al-Qaeda attacks, including the murder of Cumbers, according to news reports. Two other defendants, members of Al-Qaeda,<b> </b>were sentenced to death and five others were sentenced to up to 30 years' imprisonment, the reports said.</p>
<p>The Saudi embassy in the United States and the Saudi Ministry of Justice did not respond to CPJ's requests in late 2014<b> </b>for comment. Gardner told CPJ in an email shortly after the sentence that the Saudi government had provided him and the Cumbers family with ""absolutely ZERO information about the trial."" He added that the Saudi government had never apologized nor paid any compensation to his or Cumbers' family for what he said was Saudi incompetence in both ensuring security for the crew and handling the aftermath of the shooting.</p>
<p>Cumbers' father, Robert, said in a <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30092029"">statement</a> after the November 2014 sentencing that he had ""mixed feelings"" about the issuing of a death sentence. He said he was relieved the wait was over but expressed sympathy to Al-Dhubaiti's parents.</p>
<p>On January 2, 2016, the Saudi Ministry of Interior said in a <a href=""https://twitter.com/spagov/status/683192398172782593"">statement</a> it had executed 47 prisoners, including al-Dhubaiti.

was gunned down by unidentified assailants in the border city of Tijuana, 
in Baja California State. 

<p>The journalist had just left a physical therapy clinic with his two 
children when masked gunmen in a vehicle pulled up to his car and 
shot him four times in the head and neck. Ortiz Franco died at the 
scene. His children were unharmed. </p>

<p>Later that day, Mexican President Vicente Fox telephoned<i> </i>J. 
Jesús Blancornelas, <i>Zeta</i>'s publisher and editor, to 
promise federal support for the investigation. The week after the 
murder, <i>Zeta</i> published an investigative article naming several 
possible suspects, including gunmen linked to the powerful Arellano 
Félix drug cartel.</p>

<p>One of the founders of <i>Zeta</i> in 1980, Ortiz Franco wrote editorials 
and worked on many investigative reports. He also served on a panel 
created by the Mexican government and the Inter American Press Association 
to review official investigations into the murders of Héctor 
Félix Miranda, <i>Zeta'</i>s co-founder, and Víctor 
Manuel Oropeza, a columnist with the <i>Diario de Juárez</i> 
newspaper.</p>

<p>The Baja California State Attorney's office initially headed the investigation, 
but federal authorities assumed control in August. Federal prosecutor 
José Luis Vasconcelos said several men under arrest for separate 
crimes had identified the killers and connected the murder to the 
Tijuana drug cartel controlled by the Arellano Félix family. 
The connection to drug trafficking, a federal offense in Mexico, opened 
the door for federal investigators to take over.</p>

<p>Ortiz Franco seldom wrote about drug trafficking during his long tenure 
at <i>Zeta</i>, but he began to develop new sources in the months 
before he was killed. Investigators believe that Ortiz Franco was 
killed because of his work as a journalist and are considering stories 
he wrote about the Arellano Félix cartel as the probable motive. </p>

<p><i>Zeta</i> has covered corruption and drug trafficking in Tijuana 
for many years, with its award-winning reports prompting threats and 
attacks against its journalists.</p>

<p>In November 1997, members of the Arellano Félix drug cartel 
wounded Blancornelas, and killed his friend and bodyguard, Luis Valero 
Elizalde. In April 1988, Miranda was fatally shot by two men working 
as security guards at a racetrack owned by Jorge Hank Rhon, an influential 
businessman who was elected mayor of Tijuana in August. </p>",,,,,2004,MX,MX,.mx,Mexico,mexico,Americas,americas,americas,Mexico,Confirmed

<p>Witnesses told the English-language <i>Daily Star</i> that the assailant, 
posing as a peanut seller, approached Kabir and tossed at least two 
homemade bombs at him, fatally injuring him in the abdomen and the 
legs. Kabir was taken to Khulna Medical College Hospital and died 
soon after. Kabir's son Asif also suffered minor injuries on his legs 
and was treated at a local clinic.</p>

<p>An underground leftist group known as Janajuddha (People's War), a 
faction of the Purbo Banglar Communist Party, claimed responsibility 
for the murder in phone calls to several local newspapers and journalists 
the day of the murder, according to local journalists.</p>

<p>Kabir, 58, was a veteran journalist and the president of the Khulna 
Press Club. He published bold articles criticizing the organized crime 
that plagues Bangladesh's troubled southwestern region. After his 
friend and fellow journalist Manik Saha was murdered in a similar 
attack earlier in 2004, Kabir criticized the criminal elements implicated 
in Saha's killing. Janajuddha also claimed responsibility for Saha's 
murder. Kabir had recently received death threats, according to local

may have been killed because of his work. Klebnikov, 41, a U.S. journalist 
of Russian descent, was shot at least nine times from a passing car. 
<p></p>

<p>Klebnikov was the 11th journalist in Russia to be killed in a contract-style

according to CPJ research. No one had been brought to justice in any 
of the cases.</p>

<p>A special crimes unit is investigating Klebnikov's murder, Prosecutor 
General Vladimir Ustinov said.</p>

<p>On September 28, Moscow police said they arrested two Chechen men 
suspected in the murder. But the suspects denied involvement, and 
police backed off their initial assertion. Less than two months later, 
on November 18, Moscow police and the Belarusian security service 
arrested three other Chechens considered suspects in the murder. Authorities 
provided only limited information about the evidence they used to 
link the new suspects to the crime. </p>

<p>Some analysts reacted to the arrests with skepticism. After the September 
arrests were reported, Oleg Panfilov, director of the Moscow-based 
press freedom group Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations, told 
an interviewer that authorities were pursuing a ""farfetched Chechen 
trail.""</p>

significant attention a month later when it published a list of Russia's

<p>Klebnikov had written a number of books and articles that angered 
his subjects. His investigations often focused on the synergy of Russian

daily <i>Listín Diario</i>. Jorge Luis Sención, a radio 
reporter who witnessed the attack, was later shot in a second ambush 
and lost his right forearm to amputation.</p>

<p>The attack came amid an escalating crime wave in Azua, 75 miles (120 
kilometers) south of the capital, Santo Domingo. Several Dominican 
journalists who have reported on the crime surge have been threatened 
with death and are under police protection, according to press reports.</p>

<p>Andújar left the station at around 9:40 a.m. with colleague 
Juan Sánchez, a correspondent with the Santo Domingo-­based 
dailies <i>El Nacional</i> and <i>Hoy</i>. During the show, the reporters 
discussed the killing that morning of four reputed gang members in 
a gun battle with police, according to press reports. Andújar 
and Sánchez, as well as other journalists from Azua, had previously 
received death threats for their comments about the crime wave.</p>

<p>As the reporters were about to drive their motorcycles away, two motorcyclists 
shot at them, hitting Andújar in the head as Sánchez 
took refuge in a nearby fire station, the Dominican press reported. 
Andújar died an hour and a half later in a local hospital.</p>

<p>Sención, a reporter with Enriquillo Radio in the town of Tamayo, 
saw the ambush and aided Andújar in the immediate aftermath, 
according to a local press account. Later that morning, while with 
his pregnant wife, Sención was assaulted by the same gunmen. </p>

an uprising by loyalist youths in the south who took to the streets 
armed with machetes, iron bars, and clubs. France and other nations 
began evacuating thousands of foreigners as a result. </p>

An unidentified gunman shot photographer Lumawag, of the MindaNews

<p>Lumawag was photographing the sunset at the pier in Jolo on the last 
day of Ramadan in the Muslim-majority area when he was killed by a 
single bullet to the head, according to local news accounts. Lumawag, 
26, had traveled to Jolo with another reporter on November 10 to work 
on a video documentary about transparency and local governing practices 
for the U.S.-based Asia Foundation. </p>

<p>Sulu Province, comprising a group of islands 310 miles (500 kilometers) 
south of the capital, Manila, is a bastion for the Islamic separatist 
group Abu Sayyaf, The Associated Press reported. Abu Sayyaf has been 
linked to al-Qaeda and has made headlines in recent years with high-profile 
kidnappings for ransom. The island province is also a stronghold for 
Jemaah Islamiah, the militant Islamic group.</p>

<p>The exact motive for Lumawag's murder was unclear, and local police 
and army spokesmen put forward different theories. Army investigators 
told Mindanews Chairwoman Carolyn Arguillas, who had accompanied Lumawag, 
that they suspected Abu Sayyaf members were responsible for the killing. 
The head of the local antiterrorism unit, Brig. Gen. Agustin Dema-ala, 
also claimed in local news reports that the gunman's description matched 
that of a wanted local Abu Sayyaf operative. </p>

<p>But in an interview with the <em>Philippine Daily Inquirer</em>, local 
police head, Chief Superintendent Vidal Querol, said that a corruption 
story the two journalists were pursuing was the likely motive. Local 
news accounts also speculated that Lumawag might have been mistaken 
as a spy or member of the military because his clothes resembled fatigues,

<p>According to a report in <i>The Straits Times</i>, local police said the murder was likely in reprisal for Hinolan exposés ""on illegal gambling, police brutality and corruption by local government executives.""</p>
<p>Hinolan was known as a ""hard-hitting commentator,"" local Chief Superintendent George Alino told Agence France-Presse. In a statement, Bombo Radyo managers accused ""assassins"" of ""killing the messenger who is tasked to serve the public by way of exposing the truth."" The station offered a reward for any information leading to the identification or capture of those responsible for Hinolan's murder.</p>


    	    <p>Former Lezo town mayor Alfredo Arcenio went into hiding for a year before surrendering to authorities after being identified by two witnesses as the gunman in the crime, according to reports. Hinolan's widow, Aphrodite Hinolan, requested that the trial be held outside of Aklan province due to concerns of possible political interference in local courts. In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled to transfer the venue to Cebu City.</p>
<p>Arcenio maintained his innocence during the trial, claiming in court testimony that he was attending a wake at a friend's home in Lezo town at the time of Hinolan's killing. His legal defense filed a series of petitions and motions to delay the proceedings, a tactic commonly used by defendants in Philippine murder cases to break the will of prosecutors, family members and witnesses, CPJ research shows.   </p>
<p>On August 11, 2016, after eight years of court proceedings, Cebu City's regional trial court found Arcenio guilty of homicide in Hinolan's death, <a href=""http://www.interaksyon.com/article/131306/ex-aklan-mayor-convicted-of-journos-2004-killing"">news reports</a> said. Presiding judge Sylva Paderanga sentenced Arcenio to eight to 14 years in prison and ordered him to pay 237,500 pesos (US$5,000) in damages to Hinolan's family. The conviction was handed down despite two of three prosecution witnesses recanting testimony they had earlier given to the court against Arcenio.</p>
<p>The National Union of Journalists, a local press group, welcomed the judgment as a ""partial victory"" because Arcenio was convicted of the lesser charge of homicide rather than murder. Explaining their decision to convict Arcenio of the lesser charge, the judges ruled that prosecutors had failed to prove the two elements of treachery and premeditation, <a href=""http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/805363/conviction-of-ex-mayor-over-radiomans-death-a-partial-victory-nujp"">reports</a> said.

Two other staff members of <em>The Point</em>, Ida Jagne-Joof and Nyang Jobe, were in the car with Hydara and were wounded in the attack.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The shooting occurred two days after the Gambian National Assembly passed two contentious pieces of media legislation that Hydara, along with other local independent journalists, had strongly opposed. One of the new laws imposes lengthy jail terms for reporters convicted of defamation or sedition. </p>
<p>Hydara also wrote two columns for <em>The Point</em> that frequently criticized the government, according to local journalists.</p>
<p>In the years before the killing, Gambian journalists and media outlets have been targeted in successive arson attacks, for which no one has been prosecuted. The most recent attack occurred in August, when the home of BBC correspondent Ebrima Sillah was burned down following a threatening letter sent to the BBC accusing Sillah's reporting of being biased against President Jammeh.</p>
<p>In the prior two years, unidentified assailants have twice set fire to property belonging to the private, Banjul-based <em>Independent</em>, which is known for its critical stance toward the government. These attacks resembled an August 2000 arson attack on the offices of the independent Banjul-based station Radio 1 FM.</p>
<p>On June 10, 2014, a panel of three justices in the Nigeria-based Economic Community of West African States Court of Justice <a href=""/2014/06/ecowas-court-rules-gambia-failed-to-investigate-jo.php"">ruled</a> that Gambia's National Intelligence Agency, which was tasked with investigating Hydara's murder, did not carry out a proper investigation and cited the agency's failure to carry out ballistic tests on the bullets and weapons recovered from suspects. The court said the NIA was ""not an impartial body to conduct the investigation"" but added that there was no evidence linking the Gambian government to the murder.</p>
<p>The court awarded US$50,000 to Hydara's family as compensation for the government's failure to investigate the murder and US$10,000 for legal costs.

<p>Prins published and wrote for <i>Apocalipsis</i>, a small critical newspaper that he distributed on the streets of Magangué. In the paper, he often criticized Jorge Luis Alfonso López, Magangué's mayor from 2004 to 2007, as well as right-wing paramilitaries, who in the 1980s, '90s, and early 2000s colluded with the Colombian army and local politicians and landowners to target Marxist guerrillas and suspected leftists.</p>
<p>Prins, 43, was also a left-wing politician who was serving on a neighborhood council in Magangué at the time of his death. Prior to this, he also briefly served in Alfonso López's administration as a transportation official, but soon resigned from the position citing widespread corruption, according to <a href=""http://www.elheraldo.co/local/el-periodista-que-mataron-por-su-apocalipsis-179376"">news reports</a>.</p>

<p>On December 31, 2014, Alfonso López was convicted on charges of ordering the murder of Prins, according to <a href=""http://www.elheraldo.co/judicial/condenado-39-anos-hijo-de-la-gata-por-matar-periodista-179111"">news reports</a>.

During the year-long trial, former paramilitaries testified that Alfonso López had ordered them to murder Prins because the mayor was upset over the journalist's critical coverage of his administration. In his articles, Prins had accused the mayor of corruption involving the municipal health and transportation agencies and of having links to paramilitaries, according to <a href=""http://www.elheraldo.co/local/el-periodista-que-mataron-por-su-apocalipsis-179376"">news reports</a>.</p>

  A gunman walked into columnist Marlene Garcia-Esperat's house in the city of Tacurong, and shot her in front of her family. Garcia-Esperat died at the scene from a single bullet wound to her head, police told reporters. The gunman and his accomplice escaped from the scene on a motorcycle.<br />
  <br />
  An anti-graft columnist for the <em>Midland Review</em> in the southern island of Mindanao, Garcia-Esperat, 45, was under police protection as a result of death threats. Local news reports said that on the day of the shooting she let her two guards leave early for the Easter holiday.<br />
  <br />
  The Philippine National Police Chief, General Arturo Lomibao told reporters ""the motive is work-related as media practitioner."" In a radio interview, George Esperat said that his wife had ""made many enemies because of her exposés"" and that she had received death threats via text message. He also suggested Garcia-Esperat's murder was connected to a corruption story that she wrote, accusing a police officer of involvement in illegal logging activity. Tacurong Police Chief Raul Supiter said that no motive had been ruled out, according to the Philippines-based MindaNews news service.<br />
  <br />
  On April 11, police announced the arrest of four suspects, including an army sergeant. The four were said to confess their involvement, according to local reports. Newspapers reported several possible leads as to the mastermind; those reports included allegations that two officials from the Mindanao Department of Agriculture, Osmeña Montañer and Estrella Sabay, plotted Garcia-Esperat's murder. The officials denied the accusations, but one of the defendants, Randy Barua, a former bodyguard for Sabay, told police that he hired the gunmen at the behest of Montañer and Sabay, the <em>Philippine Daily Inquirer</em> reported.<br />
  <br />
  Murder charges were brought against the two officials, but a judge dismissed them on August 31 because of what he termed insufficient and conflicting evidence. The Esperat family lawyer, Nena Santos, told the <em>Manila Standard</em> that the dismissal was ""highly questionable and suspicious,"" and that it was a ""miscarriage of justice."" Santos said the judge made the decision the day before being transferred to another jurisdiction, and the court clerk did not announce the ruling until September 20.<br />
  <br />
  Press freedom groups protested the dismissal of charges against the accused masterminds. The four initial defendants also complained to President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Gerry Cabayag, identified as the gunman, said he was afraid of retribution from the two agriculture officials, the <em>Inquirer</em> reported.<br />
  <br />
  A chemist by training, Garcia-Esperat began her work exposing corruption in the early 1990s. During her tenure as ombudsman for the Department of Agriculture, she filed legal actions against several officials accusing them of graft, according to the <em>Inquirer</em>. She also spent two years in the witness protection program due to her ombudsman discoveries.<br />
  <br />
  Garcia-Esperat became a full-time journalist in 2004 after growing frustrated with the government's tepid reaction to corruption, she told the <em>Inquirer</em> in an earlier interview. She started hosting a program on local radio station DXKR in 2001, and began her column ""Madame Witness"" at the end of 2002. Garcia-Esperat was also a longtime source for many journalists.",,,,,2005,RP,PH,.ph,Philippines,philippines,Asia,asia,asia,Philippines,Confirmed

ex-soldiers occupied the police station in the southwestern city. The
Associated Press reported that three people, including a Sri Lankan
peacekeeper, died in the gun battle.<br />

colleagues were on the nearby balcony of Tele Contact's offices, when
the journalist was struck by two shots to the head and neck, the AP

that he was transferred to Santo Domingo, in the Dominican Republic,
and later to Cuba.<br />

Wilner Saint-Preux, a journalist for Tele Contact, told CPJ that
Laraque and other station reporters were trying to cover the skirmish.

region town shortly after the 21-year-old cameraman arrived to film
illegal drag racing. Authorities initially classified the death as a
traffic accident, but colleagues believed Makeev was killed to prevent
his reporting, according to CPJ interviews.<br />
			  <br /> The body,
which had multiple bruises and fractures, was found in a ditch around 1
a.m. The road connecting Azov with the town of Bataysk is the site of
drag races organized by local young people, which draw large crowds and
illegal betting. Residents said the races had been going on for years,
but police had not stopped them.&nbsp;Makeev and a colleague had gone to film a race for a report for the Puls television
station. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

Police discovered a pool of blood on the road 50 feet (15 meters) from
Makeev's body, according to local reports and CPJ interviews,
indicating the body might have been dragged to the ditch. No tire marks
were found on the pavement.&nbsp;Makeev's video camera and cell phone were missing. Police said they
discovered the car that allegedly hit Makeev, but no arrests were
reported.<br />

The investigation was transferred to the Rostov regional prosecutor's
office. ""Investigators do not consider Makeev's professional activity
to be a possible motive for the crime,"" Elena Velikova, press secretary
for the prosecutor, told CPJ. But at least two journalists told CPJ
that they believed Markeev's death was linked to his work. They noted
that reporters who have tried to cover drag racing have often been
threatened.<br />

Aleksei Sklyarov, Puls general director, told CPJ that racers would not
want to see Makeev report on an illegal event. Grigory Bochkaryov,
Rostov expert for the Moscow-based press freedom organization Center
for Journalism in Extreme Situations, told CPJ that traffic police
often accept bribes in exchange for allowing the drag races. In a
report following Makeev's death, Puls said the drag races typically
attract large crowds, and it asked why no witnesses had come forward.<br />
			  <br /><div>Makeev's colleagues conducted their own investigation because Rostov
prosecutors would not discuss the case and closed the investigation,
claiming an ""absence of evidence of a crime,"" Sklyarov told CPJ.
Eyewitnesses told the journalists that a drag racing vehicle struck
Makeev, and that a suspected race organizer threw Makeev's camera into
a nearby river after watching its footage, Sklayrov said.&nbsp;Colleague Sergei Bondarenko, who had accompanied Makeev to the site, was so shaken by the episode that he left Puls soon afterward, the station reported.<br />

Tueni was killed the day after he returned from Paris, where he had spent considerable time because of safety concerns. The Lebanese opposition blamed the attacks on Syria, which denied them.<br />
  <br />
The bombing came on the day that the United Nations Security Council received a report on a U.N. investigation into the February 14, 2005, assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri.<br />
  <br />
Since al-Hariri's murder and the launch of the U.N. inquiry, prominent <em>Al-Nahar</em> columnist Samir Qassir was killed in one car bombing and Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. talk show host May Chidiac was seriously wounded in another.<br />
  <br />
Tueni was a prominent opposition politician and was active in protests following al-Hariri's assassination. Those protests helped prompt Syria to withdraw from Lebanon.<br />
  <br />
Tueni was well-known for his <em>Al-Nahar</em> columns. He helped break an important press taboo in 2000 when he wrote a front-page letter to Bashar al-Assad, son and heir apparent to Syrian president Hafez al-Assad. The letter called for the redeployment and withdrawal of Syrian troops in Lebanon under the 1990 Taif Accords that ended Lebanon's civil war. Although Tueni's letter triggered a public outcry from some newspapers and Lebanese officials, other writers followed his lead.",,,,,2005,LE,LB,.lb,Lebanon,lebanon,Middle East,mideast,mideast,Lebanon,Confirmed

Moscow, died in the Tula city hospital after undergoing surgery for a
serious head injury he sustained in an attack two weeks before,
according to CPJ interviews and local press reports.<br />
            <br />
            Kochetkov was Tula correspondent for the Moscow daily <em>Trud</em> and a columnist for the local newspaper <em>Tulsky Molodoi Kommunar</em>, reporting on politics, social issues, and culture.<br />
            <br />
At least one assailant struck Kochetkov on the head with a blunt object
and robbed him of a bag and cell phone as he approached his home in
Tula on the evening of December 27, 2005, sources told CPJ. The bag was
believed to have contained Kochetkov's passport, press card, credit
card, and work-related documents. The attackers did not take
Kochetkov's money or an expensive fur coat he was wearing. When a
neighbor found Kochetkov's bag in her apartment building's basement,
the bag contained everything but the documents related to Kochetkov's
work, according to CPJ interviews with Kochetkov's parents, Valentina
and Yuri, and Lena Shuletova, a friend and colleague.<br />
            <br />
On the night of the attack, the news agency ANN reported, Kochetkov
told his parents he was meeting an unidentified person, after which he
would return home to download his work onto his computer. That evening,
Valentina and Yuri Kochetkov told CPJ, the journalist called from a
local coffee shop and told them that he'd be home in an hour. On the
way, he was attacked.<br />
            <br />
Two neighbors found Kochetkov lying unconscious on the ground at around
2 a.m. on December 28. After regaining consciousness, Kochetkov walked
home with the help of neighbors. He did not seek immediate medical
attention or report the attack to the police.<br />
            <br />
Kochetkov was not admitted to the hospital until the next day, when
doctors diagnosed him with two hematomas and said his condition was not
life-threatening, Yuri Kochetkov told CPJ. Kochetkov's health began
deteriorating January 1. He underwent brain surgery on January 5 and
fell into a coma and died three days later. An autopsy showed Kochetkov
had suffered a skull fracture, a concussion, multiple chest bruises,
and other head injuries, according to press reports and CPJ interviews.
Kochetkov never identified his attackers.<br />
            <br />
The Kochetkovs reported the attack on January 7, and police opened a
criminal investigation, the parents told CPJ. By January 9, police said
that they had identified a suspect.<br />
            <br />
On April 3, Tula prosecutors announced they had completed their
investigation and determined Kochetkov's death to be the result of a
robbery. That same day, prosecutors filed robbery and manslaughter
charges against Yan Stakhanov, a 26-year-old Tula businessman.<br />
            <br />
Police did not focus on Kochetkov's work as a motive. Investigators did
not question colleagues about Kochetkov's recent assignments, nor did
they look at the reporter's computer or notebooks for leads. CPJ
research shows that Kochetkov had worked on sensitive issues prior to
his murder.<br />
            <br />
            Just prior to the attack, Kochetkov wrote an article in <em>Trud</em>
on the activities of a Tula drug-dealing group. The December 16 article
was headlined, ""Revenge of the Mafia?"" In June 2005, Kochetkov
criticized the aggressive business practices of a local pharmaceutical
company in another article.<br />
            <br />
            Journalists at <em>Tulsky Molodoi Kommunar</em>
said in late March that Kochetkov had received telephone threats in
retaliation for his reporting, the Moscow-based news Web site <em>Newsinfo</em>
said. Kochetkov's colleagues believed that he had enemies, but they
said he never shared personal information, the Moscow-based news Web
site <em>Press-Attache</em> said.<br />
            <br /> The trial of
Stakhanov opened on April 17 in the Proletarski district court in Tula.
Although the trial was said to be open, only one journalist at a time
was admitted to the hearings. Officials cited lack of space in the
courtroom, Valentina and Yuri Kochetkov told CPJ. Before the trial,
Stakhanov allegedly confessed to killing Kochetkov but said later that
the confession was coerced, local press reports said. During the trial,
prosecutors said the assault on Kochetkov was part of a string of
robberies in Tula, according to local press reports. The trial was
recessed in September without an immediate date to reconvene, colleague
Shuletova said.<br />
            <br />

Witnesses said one of the assailants got off the motorcycle, argued with Rojas, and shot him twice at close range, the local press reported. One bullet shattered Rojas' collarbone, while the other caused severe head injuries.<br />
 <br />
 Rojas underwent repeated surgery for head injuries in Montería, his physician, Jesús Jímenez Isaza, told CPJ. On March 18, Rojas was moved to the Salucoop Clinic in Medellín to receive specialized medical attention, his daughter Erly Rojas said.<br />
 <br />
 Known as ""El Gaba,"" Rojas had been on the air for more than 30 years. His popular ""El Show de El Gaba"" featured music, news, and commentary that often focused on government corruption. He had earned a regional reputation for voicing listeners' social and political concerns.<br />
 <br />
 In April, local police arrested four men in connection with the murder. Luis Armando Díaz Berrocal, the local prosecutor in charge of the case, told CPJ that two were paramilitary fighters. The four denied involvement in the slaying, he said. Díaz said that Rojas' journalism--especially his criticism of local officials and paramilitary forces--was considered a strong motive. Local reporters also told CPJ that they believe his tough commentary had sparked retaliation.<p></p>

 <br />
 The stadium is near Universidad Central de Venezuela, where demonstrators were protesting the recent killing of three young brothers. The slayings ignited street protests demanding a crackdown on crime, the Venezuelan press said.<br />
 <br />
 After completing the stadium assignment, Aguirre decided to cover the nearby protest. He got into a white Toyota Corolla, provided by <em>El Mundo</em> and marked with the paper's logo. As Aguirre's car neared the protest around 3:30 p.m., a man driving a blue Yamaha motorcycle approached. The motorcyclist demanded that driver Julio Canelón stop the car, Rondón said. When Canelón asked why, the motorcyclist responded that he was with the authorities but did not show any identification, the editor told CPJ.<br />
 <br />
 Rondón said the driver did not stop and proceeded to the protest scene. The motorcyclist followed and shot Aguirre four times as he was getting out of the car with his camera. Aguirre managed to take a picture of the killer's back fleeing the scene on his motorcycle, Rondón said. With the help of bystanders, the driver put Aguirre in the car and took him to a local hospital. The journalist died a few hours later.<br />

Police also publicly identified four additional suspects identified as Juri, Leung, Slamet, and Abdul Basyir, none of whom were immediately apprehended. It is customary for many Indonesians to use only one name.<br />
 <br />
 According to public statements made on September 29 by Probolinggo Resort Police Chief Nana Sudjana, Herliyanto's murder was directly related to the journalist's April 9 newspaper report concerning official corruption in a bridge project in the nearby village of Rejing. Herliyanto's report alleged that 120 million rupiah (US$13,165) was pilfered from a local infrastructure fund, CPJ sources said.<br />

 Sudjana accused Basyir, the village official who oversaw the Reijing bridge project, of both planning and participating in the murder.

had died in a blast caused by explosives within the house. International news media

possibly fired from a U.S. drone.<o:p></o:p></p>

five or six bullet wounds and that one hand had been manacled in handcuffs
typically used by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate. Mahmud

presence of the handcuffs as circumstantial and said the cuffs could have been

shot by an unidentified gunman while filming a demonstration in the
Somali capital. He was a longtime contributor to Britain's Channel 4
News. At the time of death, he was freelancing for several newspapers
including the Swedish daily <em>Aftonbladet</em>.<br />
            <br />
An Associated Press reporter who witnessed the murder said the gunman
came up from behind Adler and shot him in the back at close range
before disappearing into the crowd. Adler died instantly. He was
covering a demonstration organized by the Islamic Courts Union, which
seized control of Mogadishu on June 5 from warlords backed by the
United States. Several reports said he was filming demonstrators
burning U.S. and Ethiopian flags. The National Union of Somali
Journalists reported that Adler was standing in the crowd, not in the
heavily guarded area where many other journalists and Islamic courts
leaders were standing.<br />
            <br />
The rally, attended by thousands, was in support of a peace agreement
reached June 22 in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, between the Islamic
courts and Somalia's transitional government. Demonstrators also
protested against suggestions that foreign peacekeepers be sent to
Somalia, according to the BBC. Anti-foreigner sentiment had been stoked
by reports that some warlords had gotten CIA financing to help capture
suspected al-Qaeda members in Somalia. International journalists had
been stoned and harassed while reporting on demonstrations, AP said.<br />
            <br />
In a statement, Britain's Independent Television News company called
Adler ""a long-term friend"" who had ""contributed outstanding journalism
and filmmaking."" Adler won many international awards, including the
2001 Amnesty International Media Award, a Silver Prize for
investigative journalism at the 2001 New York Film Festival, and the
2004 Rory Peck Award for hard news for a report that that exposed
abuses by U.S. troops in Iraq. He had worked in more than two dozen war
zones, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Rwanda, Congo, and Sierra
Leone.<br />

Front. But in May 2005, he was detained for several days, fined 8
million Sudanese pounds (US$3,200), and his paper was closed for three
months after he offended the country's powerful Islamists by
republishing an article from the Internet that questioned the ancestry
of the Prophet Muhammad. Demonstrators outside the courthouse demanded
he be sentenced to death for blasphemy. Sudan is religiously
conservative and penalizes blasphemy and insulting Islam with the death
penalty.</p>
            <p>
            Six months before the slaying, unidentified assailants set fire to the offices of <em>Al-Wifaq</em>, badly damaging the building. The perpetrators were never identified, a CPJ source said.</p>
            <p>
Several Sudanese journalists gathered at the Khartoum morgue to protest
the murder and demand government protection for the press. The
Arabic-language satellite news channel Al-Jazeera said Taha had fought
many battles with the government and opposition parties over his
writings and had made many political enemies. </p><p>

</p><p>In April 2009, the Sudanese government executed nine men found guilty of 
involvement in the assassinatio. Many press freedom and human rights observers saw the prosecution as a miscarriage of justice, spurred by a thirst on the part of President Omar 
al-Bashir's regime for settling scores with the rebellious region of 
Darfur.</p>

<p>All nine men were from this oppressed and poverty-stricken 
region of Sudan, which al-Bashir's power base

 <em>Al-Sabah</em> reported two weeks earlier that it had received an e-mailed death threat against al-Rubai and his family, which was signed by the military wing of the Mujahedeen Council, an al-Qaeda affiliate in Iraq.

 ""We have our reservations about this newspaper despite the fact that there are Iraqis working in it, but we condemn those false accusations against our resisting army, which issued just a few days ago a statement that forbids the killing of Muslims, especially Iraqis of any background or beliefs. But these allegations and accusations will not go unpunished, and we hold ... al-Rubai responsible for what will happen to him and his family since with the help of God we obtained their names and addresses.

34504,https://cpj.org/api/datamanager/persons/34504,Anna Politkovskaya,,Russia,,,Female,https://cpj-photos.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/politkovskaya.2006.jpg,,,Journalist,,https://cpj.org/data/people/anna-politkovskaya/index.php,https://cpj.org/cgi-bin/mt4/mt.cgi?__mode=view&_type=entry&blog_id=18&id=12855,,27:12.0,34504,Murder,Killed,Staff,Novaya Gazeta,Print Reporter,"Corruption,Human Rights,War",Print,Russia,Moscow,,,Moscow,,Local,2006,10/7/06,,7-Oct-06,2006,10/7/06,,7-Oct-06,Unknown Fire,Confirmed,,,,Partial Impunity,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>Politkovskaya, 48, a journalist renowned for her critical coverage of the Chechen conflict, was found slain in her apartment building in Moscow, according to international news reports. The Interfax news agency, citing police, said Politkovskaya had been shot and that a pistol and four bullet casings had been found.</p>
<p>Politkovskaya, special correspondent for the independent Moscow newspaper <i>Novaya Gazeta</i>, was well known for her investigative reports on human rights abuses by the Russian military in Chechnya. In seven years covering the second Chechen war, Politkovskaya's reporting repeatedly drew the wrath of Russian authorities. She was threatened, jailed, forced into exile, and poisoned during her career, CPJ research shows.</p>
<p>Igor Korolkov, a colleague, told the <i>Regnum </i>news website that Politkovskaya had been reporting on alleged torture in Chechnya.</p>
<p>CPJ had named Politkovskaya one of the world's top press freedom figures of the past 25 years in the fall 2006 edition of its magazine, <i>Dangerous Assignments</i>. In an interview for that profile, Politkovskaya noted the government's obstruction and harassment of journalists trying to cover the Chechen conflict and pointed to the deadly 2004 hostage crisis in the North Ossetian town of Beslan. ""There is so much more to write about Beslan,"" she told CPJ, ""but it gets more and more difficult when all the journalists who write are forced to leave.""</p>
<p>Politkovskaya was poisoned on her way to cover the Beslan crisis. After drinking tea on a flight to the region, she became seriously ill and was hospitalized--but the toxin was never identified because the medical staff was instructed to destroy her blood tests.</p>
<p>Politkovskaya had been threatened and attacked numerous times in retaliation for her work. In February 2001, CPJ research shows, security agents detained her in the Vedeno district in Chechnya, accusing her of entering Chechnya without accreditation. She was kept in a pit for three days without food or water, while a military officer threatened to shoot her. Seven months later, she received death threats from a military officer accused of crimes against civilians. She was forced to flee to Vienna after the officer sent an e-mail to <i>Novaya Gazeta </i>promising that he would seek revenge.</p>
<p>When Politkovskaya covertly visited Chechnya in 2002 to investigate new allegations of human rights abuses, CPJ research shows, security officers arrested her, kept her overnight at a military base, and threatened her. In October of that year, Politkovskaya served as a mediator between armed Chechen fighters and Russian forces during a hostage standoff in a central Moscow theater. Two days into the crisis, with the Kremlin restricting media coverage, Russian forces gassed the theater and 129 hostages died. Politkovskaya delivered some of the most compelling accounts of the tragedy.</p>
<p>In 2009, a Moscow jury acquitted three suspected conspirators, the brothers Ibragim and Dzhabrail Makhmudov and former Moscow police officer Sergei Khadzhikurbanov. Another Makhmudov brother, Rustam, whom authorities identified as the gunman, was at large at the time. Investigators acknowledged they had rushed a poorly prepared case to trial. An appellate court later granted a re-trial.</p>
<p>The case moved forward again in 2012, when prosecutors indicted Dmitry Pavlyuchenkov, a retired police lieutenant colonel, on charges that he helped orchestrate the murder. Authorities accused Pavlyuchenkov, head of surveillance for Moscow's main police force in 2006, of ordering subordinates to follow Politkovskaya and determine her schedule and usual travel routes. The information was then passed along to the gang hired to kill the journalist, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>In December 2012, Pavlyuchenkov was <a href=""/2012/12/russia-still-far-from-solving-politkovskaya-murder.php"">sentenced</a> to 11 years in prison on charges that he was an accomplice in the plot. Family and colleagues were dismayed by the ruling, which came after a closed proceeding; lawyers for Politkovskaya's family said they would appeal. Colleagues and relatives had <a href=""/2012/10/justice-long-overdue-in-anna-politkovskaya-murder.php"">hoped</a> Pavlyuchenkov would identify the masterminds in open court.</p>
<p>Following the verdict, investigators said they considered exiled tycoon Boris Berezovsky and Chechen envoy Akhmed Zakayev to be the masterminds--an assertion dismissed by Politkovskaya's representatives as unfounded and politically motivated.</p>
<p>Five other suspects were in detention in late 2012, including all three Makhmudov brothers, former officer Khadzhikurbanov, and Chechen underground leader Lom-Ali Gaitukayev. Prosecutors said Gaitukayev served as the main organizer and liaison between the masterminds and Pavlyuchenkov.</p>
<p>On May 20, 2014, a Moscow City Court jury found the five defendants guilty of planning, participating, and carrying out Politkovskaya's murder, <a href=""http://lenta.ru/news/2014/05/20/guilty/"" target=""_blank"">local</a> and <a href=""http://www.trust.org/item/20140520182734-o6tel"" target=""_blank"">international</a> press reported. On July 9, 2014, the court <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/10/world/europe/moscow-court-sentences-5-to-prison-for-contract-killing-of-anna-politkovskaya.html?_r=2"">sentenced</a> Rustam Makhmudov, the convicted gunman, and Gaitukayev, the organizer of the crime, to life terms in prison. Two other Makhmudov brothers, Dzhabrail and Ibragim, convicted as the gunman's driver and lookout, received 14- and 12-year jail terms, respectively. Convicted as an accomplice to the murder, Khadzhikurbanov received 20 years in prison. No one was tried as the suspected mastermind.</p>
<p>Anna Stavitskaya, lawyer for Politkovskaya's adult children, told CPJ, ""My clients, Ilya and Vera Politkovsky, are convinced that the men sentenced indeed bear responsibility in the murder. But they are also convinced that the crime is far from being fully solved."" Frustrated with the course of the investigation, the journalist's family applied to the European Court of Human Rights, which could intervene if it concluded local authorities did not carry out a proper inquiry.</p>
<p>On June 24, 2014, the Moscow City Court said it would hear Pavlyuchenkov's appeal to postpone the start of his prison term because of alleged health problems, including mental health issues. (Pavlyuchenkov was being held in a detention facility pending appeals.) A court scheduled a hearing for his case on August 18, 2014.</p>
<p>Stavitskaya told the Russian service of the U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that the family believed there were no grounds for postponing Pavlyuchenkov's sentence. ""There are many people who appeal for release or postponement of their terms in connection with their health conditions,"" she said. ""But their appeals are routinely rejected by the courts, even though oftentimes the crimes they are convicted of are of economic nature. Pavlyuchenkov was convicted of murder. He admitted his guilt and has been under arrest for a long time now. There are no reasons to believe that he cannot continue to be under arrest.""</p>
<p>Politkovskaya's former colleagues at <i>Novaya Gazeta </i>said Pavlyuchenkov knew much more about the murder than he had revealed. They said the investigating authorities were aware of this <a href=""http://en.novayagazeta.ru/columns/62144.html"" target=""_blank"">but had not pressed him to speak</a>. They said the official investigation was lacking in other ways as well: They said it had become clear a number of officers with the police's elite secret department and the Federal Security Service (FSB) played roles in the murder, but none of the officers were brought to justice.</p>
<p>Karinna Moskalenko, one of the Politkovskaya family lawyers, said she <a href=""http://www.echo.msk.ru/blog/karina_moskalenko/1323900-echo/"" target=""_blank"">was skeptical</a> about the 2014 verdicts and sentencing. ""The life terms given to two secondary culprits in the murder,"" Moskalenko told CPJ, ""are an attempt to avert the international attention away from the case, and from the fact that Anna Politkovskaya's killing remains unsolved.""</p>",,,,,2006,RS,RU,.ru,Russia,russia,Europe,europe,europe,Russia,Confirmed

local teachers union sparked a wave of antigovernment protests. After
Oaxaca Gov. Ulises Ruiz Ortiz ordered police to disperse protesters
with tear gas on June 14, leftist, indigenous, and student groups
joined the protests, which became violent. APPO protesters had been
calling for the ouster of Ruiz since the confrontation began. Several

 <br />
 Maksimov was last seen on June 29, 2004, when he went to meet with a source in the city's downtown district, the business daily <em>Kommersant</em> reported. A month later, police found his car parked near a local hotel. Maksimov's mobile phone without its SIM card resurfaced at a local flea market at about the same time, according to local press reports.<br />
 <br />
 Investigators and colleagues did not initially focus on Maksimov's journalism as a reason for his disappearance. At the time, Maksimov was seeking to trade his apartment in downtown St. Petersburg for a bigger one. Colleagues believed that he might have fallen victim to the organized crime gangs that control the real estate market in St. Petersburg, the news Web site <em>Gazeta</em> reported.<br />
 <br />
 For an entire year after the disappearance, police and prosecutors did not report any developments in the investigation. In June 2005, several Russian newspapers reported on the detention of at least three police officers--all senior investigators in the corruption division of the Northwestern Federal District's Interior Ministry. The three were said to be suspects in Maksimov's disappearance and suspected murder.<br />
 <br />
 The initial report came from the news agency Interfax and cited an anonymous source in the Northwestern Federal District's Prosecutor-General's Office. The report said that investigators believed that Maksimov was murdered for his work as a journalist and that two majors and a lieutenant colonel were considered suspects.<br />
 <br />
 The suspects, <em>Kommersant</em> said, were held on unrelated criminal charges of forgery and falsifying evidence. The English-language daily <em>Moscow Times</em> said that St. Petersburg police confirmed the Interfax report but refused to give further details.<br />
 <br />
 Soon after those reports appeared, however, on June 30, 2005, the Northwestern Federal District's Interior Ministry issued a statement denying the involvement of the three police investigators in Maksimov's disappearance. The Interior Ministry said it ""considers inadmissible and premature the appearance of press reports, accusing [the officers] of masterminding the murder of journalist Maksim Maksimov."" The Interior Ministry gave no information on how the investigation was developing. The statement generated no follow-up by the authorities.<br />
 <br />
 In the absence of official information, speculation about what could have happened to Maksimov continued to circulate in the Russian press.<br />
 <br />
 The St. Petersburg newspaper <em>Smena</em>, where Maksimov worked before joining <em>Gorod</em>, said on June 27, 2005, that it learned from unnamed sources in the St. Petersburg branch of the Interior Ministry that Maksimov disappeared was targeted by high-ranking officers in retaliation for the journalist's investigation of corruption in the local Interior Ministry. The paper said that the perpetrators, three masterminds and two executors, were in detention.<br />
 <br />
 <em>Kommersant</em> carried a similar story the next day. The paper said investigators believed Maksimov was strangled to death to prevent him from reporting on corruption in the St. Petersburg branch of the Interior Ministry. Several newspapers described in detail what they said happened to Maksimov the day he disappeared, and how he had been killed, but they did not attribute their accounts or explain how they had received the information.<br />
 <br />
 Other reports noted that Maksimov had investigated the murders of several Russian businessmen and politicians, including Galina Starovoytova, a parliamentary deputy shot in her apartment building in 1998.<br />
 <br />
 Authorities have not disclosed further information on the investigation, the identities of anyone held in connection with the crime, or the status of any criminal case. The journalist's body has not been found.<br />
 <br />
 Rimma Maksimova, Maksim Maksimov's mother, described her communication with prosecutors in charge of the investigation as ""difficult."" Maksimova told CPJ that she had received no answer to queries she sent to the Northwestern Federal District's prosecutor-general's office and the Northwestern Federal District's Interior Ministry in St. Petersburg.<br />
 <br />
 On November 24, 2006, Maksimova met with St. Petersburg Gov. Valentina Matvienko who assured her that solving Maksimov's case was a priority for St. Petersburg's administration. But the meeting did not result in any developments, and Maksimova told CPJ that authorities stopped answering her queries.",,,,,2006,RS,RU,.ru,Russia,russia,Europe,europe,europe,Russia,Confirmed

and a recipient of CPJ's International Press Freedom Award in 2002,
died in prison, several sources in the Eritrean diaspora disclosed to
CPJ in February 2007. Yohannes was among 10 independent journalists
rounded up in a massive 2001 government crackdown that shuttered the
nation's private press.</p>
  <p>Several sources said Yohannes died on
January 11, 2007, after a long illness in an undisclosed prison outside
Asmara; one source said the journalist may have died much earlier in a
prison in Embatkala, 21 miles (35 kilometers) northeast of Asmara.</p>
  <p>In
a June 2007 interview, Eritrean Information Minister Ali Abdu told CPJ
that he had nothing to say about Yohannes. ""I don't know,"" he said.
""This is an Eritrean issue; leave it to us. I have nothing to say.""</p>
  <p>Yohannes
went by the name of ""Joshua"" among family and friends. Formerly a
member of the guerrilla movement fighting for Eritrean independence
from neighboring Ethiopia, he turned to journalism when Eritrea became
a state in 1993. In November 1997, he joined <em>Setit</em> as co-owner and board member, a former colleague told CPJ. He became a popular writer, and <em>Setit</em> grew into the nation's largest-circulation newspaper.</p>
  <p><em>Setit</em>'s
staff tackled tough issues in the young nation, including poverty,
prostitution, and Eritrea's lack of infrastructure for handicapped
veterans of the 30-year independence struggle. The weekly's criticism
angered the government, and by May 2001, Yohannes asked CPJ to help him
create a journalists' union to improve press freedom conditions.</p>
  <p>He
and other journalists never got the chance. President Isaias Afewerki's
government launched a crackdown on all critical voices, including those
in the press, just one week after the September 11, 2001, attacks on
the United States had diverted the world's attention. Under the pretext
of combating terrorism, the government shut down every independent
media outlet and arrested independent journalists on sight.</p>
  At
the time, he and other imprisoned journalists still had contact with
the outside world. In May 2002, Yohannes and several other colleagues
staged a hunger strike in hopes of spurring their release. Instead,
government officials transferred the journalists to undisclosed
locations. Online news reports, which have not been confirmed, suggest
that as many as three other journalists also may have died in
government custody. The other jailed journalists continued to be held
incommunicado in secret jails throughout 2007, according to CPJ

Dink had received numerous death threats from nationalist Turks who viewed his iconoclastic journalism, particularly on the mass killings of Armenians in the early 20th century, as an act of treachery. In a January 10 article in <em>Agos</em>, Dink said he had passed along a particularly threatening letter to Istanbul's Sisli district prosecutor, but no action had been taken.</p>
 <p>Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned Dink's murder as an attack against Turkey's unity and promised to catch those responsible, according to international news reports. A day later, police arrested the alleged triggerman, 17-year-old Ogün Samast, who reportedly confessed to the crime. Erhan Tuncel and Yasin Hayal, described as ultranationalist Turks opposed to Dink's political views, were accused of conspiring with Samast to carry out the murder. In all, 19 people went on trial beginning in July.</p>
 <p>In the last 15 years, 18 other Turkish journalists have been killed for their work, many of them murdered, making it the eighth-deadliest country in the world for journalists, CPJ research shows. The last killing was in 1999. More recently, journalists, academics, and others have been subjected to pervasive legal harassment for statements that allegedly insult the Turkish identity, CPJ research shows.</p>
 <p>Dink, a Turkish citizen of Armenian descent, had been prosecuted several times in recent years-for writing about the mass killings of Armenians by Turks at the beginning of the 20th century, for criticizing lines in the Turkish national anthem that he considered discriminatory, and even for commenting publicly on the court cases against him. His office had also been the target of protests.</p>
 <p>In July 2006, Turkey's High Court of Appeals upheld a six-month suspended prison sentence against Dink for violating Article 301 of the penal code in a case sparked by complaints from nationalist activists. His prosecution stemmed from a series of articles in early 2004 dealing with the collective memory of the Armenian massacres of 1915-17 under the Ottoman Empire. Armenians call the killings the first genocide of the 20th century, a term that Turkey rejects.</p>
 <p>Ironically, the pieces for which Dink was convicted had urged diaspora Armenians to let go of their anger against the Turks. The prosecution was sharply criticized by the European Union, which Turkey has sought to join. Dink said he would take the case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, to clear his name.</p>
 <p>Dink edited <em>Agos</em> for all of the newspaper's 11-year existence. <em>Agos</em>, the only Armenian newspaper in Turkey, had a circulation of just 6,000, but its political influence was vast. Dink regularly appeared on television to express his views.</p>
 <p>In a February 2006 interview with CPJ, Dink said that he hoped his critical reporting would pave the way for peace between the two peoples. ""I want to write and ask how we can change this historical conflict into peace,"" he said.</p>
 <p>In the interview, Dink said he did not think the tide had yet turned in favor of critical writers-""the situation in Turkey is tense""-but he believed that it ultimately would. ""I believe in democracy and press freedom. I am determined to pursue the struggle.""</p>

 <p>Badio photographed gang confrontations in Martissant, where he lived with his family, and sold them to local dailies, including the Port-au-Prince newspaper <em>Le Matin</em>. Badio was a member of Delva's press group, SOS Journalistes, and the Haitian Association of Photojournalists.</p>
 <p>Rival gangs had been battling in Martissant for months, The Associated Press reported. According to the Port-au-Prince-based Radio Métropole, the escalating gang violence made Martissant one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the Haitian capital. Delva said gang members seldom allow journalists to take their pictures for fear of being identified by local authorities. According to colleagues interviewed by CPJ, Badio had received threats from local gang members beginning in October 2006.</p>
 <p>Prime Minister Jacques Edouard Alexis said he had authorized U.N. peacekeepers to increase patrols in Martissant. Still, Badio's wife and children were forced to flee their home after receiving further threats from Martissant's gangs, Delva told CPJ.</p>

The following narrative is drawn from CPJ interviews with Safronov's <em>Kommersant</em> colleagues and military experts, and from press reports.</p>
 <p>On the day he died, Safronov talked to colleagues and family by phone and made plans with them for later in the day and for the following week. He visited a Moscow doctor for treatment of an ulcer, symptoms of which had recently abated. Safronov then went grocery shopping and took a trolley back home. Around 4 p.m., two university students living in a nearby apartment building heard a thud and saw Safronov on the ground and an open window in the building above. Safronov's groceries were on the landing between the fourth and the fifth floor of his apartment building. He died before help arrived.</p>
 <p>The Taganka prosecutor's office in Moscow initially said the death was a suicide. Several days later, prosecutors opened an investigation into what they called ""incitement to suicide,"" a provision of the Russian penal code that is defined as someone provoking a suicide through threats or abusive treatment. In September, prosecutors returned to their initial theory and declared the killing a suicide.</p>
 <p>CPJ research shows Safronov had worked on a number of sensitive issues:</p>
 <p>• In late February, Safronov had returned from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, where he had covered the annual International Defense Exhibition and Conference, a gathering of defense manufacturers. Colleagues said Safronov had called the newsroom from Abu Dhabi with information about a purported Russian sale of fighter jets and anti-aircraft missiles to Syria and Iran. The sale was said to be channeled through Belarus to conceal the origin. Safronov had planned to finish the story when he returned.</p>
 <p>• Three days before his death, Safronov privately told colleagues at a news conference that he had information about an alleged Russian sale to Syria of the surface-to-air missile system Pantsir-S1, the fighter aircraft MiG-29, and the tactical missile Iskandar-E. He said he had been cautioned not to publish the information because of its international implications, but he did not say who had issued the warning.</p>
 <p>• Safronov had been interrogated many times by state security agents for allegedly disclosing state secrets in his articles. He was never formally charged because he was able to demonstrate that he had relied solely on public sources. In December 2006, Safronov angered authorities when he wrote about the third consecutive launch failure of the Bulava intercontinental ballistic missile.</p>
 <p>Relatives, friends, and colleagues said Safronov had no reason to commit suicide. He had no personal enemies, no debts, and no life-threatening disease. He had been married for many years, had two adult children, and was expecting his first grandchild. He did not leave a suicide note.</p>

remained in custody. Jaén police accused Hurtado of hiring two local
gunmen to kill the journalist. Investigators say Hurtado was angered by
on-air criticism of his girlfriend, the director of a local nonprofit
organization, according to Peruvian press reports. Hurtado denied the
accusation, the Lima-based daily <em>El Comercio</em> reported.</p>
  <p>Local colleagues and Lima-based journalists who spoke to CPJ said they were skeptical of the police investigation. According to <em>La República</em>,
Pérez promised during his last show that he would reveal the names of
 ""Jaén police officers who are in cahoots with drug traffickers and
protect gangs of criminals."" A few hours before the murder, several
witnesses saw Pérez and Police Commander Jorge Velezmoro Ruiz at a
local restaurant, <em>La República</em> reported. Velezmoro denied having seen Pérez that day, the newspaper said.</p>

He was found dead two days later near the industrial farming area of Darwendale, 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Harare, according to the same sources. Chikomba was beaten to death, sources close to his family told CPJ.</p>
 <p>Several news reports said Chikomba's killing might be linked to his alleged leaking to foreign media of footage of badly beaten opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai after the politician's release from police custody in February. Footage of Tsvangirai leaving a Harare courthouse with a suspected fractured skull, and then lying in a hospital bed, sparked international condemnation of President Robert Mugabe's regime. The footage aired on many foreign television stations, but not on ZBC, the country's sole television network, local journalists told CPJ.</p>
 <p>Police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Wayne Bvudzijena did not respond to CPJ's messages seeking comment. Chikomba was one of several senior ZBC journalists forced to step down in 2002 during a harsh media crackdown led by then-Information Minister Jonathan Moyo, according to local journalists.<br />

in these stories.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Lawyers for the suspects declined to make a

of four businessmen, five local politicians, and one other person, a waiter,
the national newspaper <i style="""">O Globo</i>
reported. Due to financial difficulties, Barbon shut down Realidade in 2004. He
ran unsuccessfully for city council the same year.</p>

The description was based on interviews with eyewitnesses and an account that Abdo provided his brother before he died, al-Sawaf said.</p>
 <p>The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate and the Palestinian Journalists Block both denounced the killings. Mohamed Edwan, a spokesman for President Mahmoud Abbas, said Fatah had nothing to do with the killings and that presidential guards were instructed to shoot only in self-defense. He said Fatah condemned the killings and urged that the perpetrators be punished.</p>
 <p>Al-Ashi and Abdo were scheduled to meet with economic and tourism organizations in Gaza that afternoon, al-Sawaf told CPJ. The fledgling <em>Palestine</em> newspaper was launched in May. The murders came amid clashes in the coastal strip between the Fatah and Hamas factions.</p>

Kidane sought to leave Eritrea because of years of professional repression, according to family, colleagues, and personal notes he sent out of the country that were reviewed by CPJ.</p>
 <p>Kidane's companions were forced to leave him in the care of residents of a village in northwest Eritrea after the journalist collapsed from seven days of walking in temperatures of more than 100 degrees, according to a woman who traveled with him and who spoke with CPJ through an interpreter. He was suffering from severe foot blisters and had an epileptic seizure, she said. Kidane's condition was not critical when the group left him, the woman insisted, saying that even in the event of complications, he would have survived had he received proper medical care. She believed Kidane may have been captured by government security forces. The village in which he was left is believed to be populated by government informants.</p>
 <p>In a telephone interview with CPJ in August, Eritrean Information Minister Ali Abdu acknowledged that the journalist died while attempting to leave the country, but he offered no information about the circumstances. ""We don't know,"" he said.</p>
 <p>Kidane's passions for sports, particularly soccer, and poetry had led him to begin his journalism career as a freelance sportswriter in his native Ethiopia in the mid-1990s, according to his brother. In May 1998, at the outbreak of the border war, he was among more than 65,000 people of Eritrean descent deported from Ethiopia. He became the sports editor of the now-defunct independent weekly <em>Admas</em> in the Eritrean capital, Asmara, according to exiled <em>Admas</em> founder Khaled Abdu. In 2000, authorities exploited his skill in Amharic and knowledge of Ethiopia by conscripting him into state media service to broadcast anti-Ethiopian propaganda, and as a film and stage actor playing the roles of villainous Ethiopian military officers. In November 2006, he was among nine state media journalists summarily detained for several weeks without charge, according to CPJ research.</p>

irregularities, including charges of inadequate forensic investigation and the
prosecution's sudden abandonment of theories implicating two soldiers as the
shooters. An appeal led to a retrial.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">In a retrial that concluded in May 2008, a military tribunal
convicted three defendants— Freddy Bisimwa, Mastakila Rwezangabo, and Patient
Bisimwa Sikitu—and sentenced them to death. The trial failed to establish a motive for the crime, according to news reports and local journalists. </p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>The tribunal overturned the convictions of Maheshe's
companions, Alain Mulimbi and Serge Muhima, according to news reports. The companions
were originally convicted on conspiracy charges based on statements from the
accused gunmen. In&nbsp;a September 2007 letter from prison, the accused gunmen retracted their accusations and said they leveled the claims at the behest of two military judges.</o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p></o:p></p>

<p>The retrial was criticized by the U.N. mission in DRC for ""many and
serious violations of the basic rights to a fair trial,"" such as the
presumption of innocence and the proper handling of evidence, according to CPJ
research. There were reports of death threats against journalists, observers,
and lawyers at the retrial, according to local and international media.&nbsp;</p>",,,,,2007,CG,CD,.cd,Democratic Republic of the Congo,democratic-republic-of-the-congo,Africa,africa,africa,Democratic Republic of the Congo,Confirmed

 <p>Iraqi police were about 1,000 feet (300 meters) from the shooting and responded quickly to the scene, the source said. Police called Sarhan's sons, who identified the body.</p>
 <p>Several CPJ sources familiar with the case said that Sarhan's work was the only plausible motive for his killing. Sarhan was a well-known journalist who worked as a managing editor at the Iraqi News Agency until the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003, according to CPJ sources. Since then, he worked as managing editor for the independent daily <em>Al-Mashriq</em> and the now-defunct weekly <em>Al-Wihda</em> <em>al-Watan</em>iya. He was the editor-in-chief of the now-defunct weekly <em>Iraqiyoun</em>. In 2005, Sarhan became the managing editor of Baghdad's municipal secretariat weekly <em>Sawt Baghdad</em>. He later became a public relations director for the secretariat.</p>
 <p>Sarhan freelanced for several national and international Arabic-language newspapers, including the Iraqi dailies <em>Azzaman</em> and <em>Al-Mashriq</em>, according to the CPJ source. He also appeared as an analyst on several programs for Iraqi satellite channels such as Al-Baghdadia and Al-Sharqiya. He regularly wrote articles and reports for <em>Sawt Baghdad</em> as part of his job for the secretariat, the source said. Al-Saydiya, located in the Al-Rasheed district controlled by al-Qaeda in Iraq, was a hotbed of violence at the time.</p>

had killed the journalist for circulating ""propaganda in support of the
monarchy,"" according to news reports. Police were unable to verify the origin
of the email, which lacked details such as the time and place of the murder, news
reports said. CPJ classified the case as missing until March 2012, after it conducted a fact-finding mission to Nepal.</p>

Without saying a word, the two assailants began to fire their weapons, the owner of the house, Aparicio Martínez, told local reporters. Palma was shot in the head, neck, arms, and legs, Vicente Paéz, secretary-general of the Paraguayan Journalists Union, told CPJ. Palma's companion, Wilma Martínez, was wounded in the leg, according to local press reports.</p>
 <p>Palma, 48, a Chilean national, often denounced organized crime, illegal smuggling of gas, and local government corruption in the southeastern province of Itapúa, a colleague at Radio Chaco Boreal, Erico González, told CPJ. Palma had also reported recently on the existence of illegal radio stations in Mayor Otaño, a small city on Paraguay's border with Argentina, 285 miles (460 kilometers) from Asunción.</p>
 <p>The reporter had received death threats for years, González told CPJ, with the anonymous calls intensifying in the month before the slaying. According to a September report from the Inter American Press Association, one of the last text messages Palma received on his cell phone said: ""I've been hired to kill you, to make you travel, we'll see each other soon.""</p>
 <p>A week prior to his death, Palma announced on the air that he was returning to Chile because of the threats, Paéz told CPJ. Palma had lived in Paraguay since 1991.

 <p>Dagoberto Rodríguez, director of Radio Cadena Voces, said he believed the killing was in retaliation for the station's critical reporting on official corruption. The Honduran Commissioner of Human Rights, Ramón Custodio López, told CPJ no other motive had come to light. Police said Salgado's murder was unrelated to his work, but they did not disclose any other motives, local press freedom advocate Thelma Mejía told CPJ.</p>
 <p>Salgado, 67, was noted for his satirical criticism of the country's political system, according to Rodríguez. His show combined humor with coverage of everyday problems, such as the prices of food and transportation. ""Frijol el Terrible,"" which was on the air for more than 20 years, reached a nationwide audience, Rodríguez said. He described Salgado as respected by his colleagues and admired by his listeners.</p>
 <p>Rodríguez told CPJ that Radio Cadena Voces had been harassed continuously for its reporting on government corruption. Over the last two years, he said, hackers had repeatedly erased information on the radio station's Web site, the staff had received anonymous telephone threats, and at least one journalist had been attacked by a local government official. Rodríguez and his family were themselves forced to flee Honduras on November 1, after police informed the journalist that his name had appeared on a hit list, Custodio told CPJ.</p>
 <p>Sandra Aguilar, the victim's wife, described Salgado as a quiet man who divided his time between the radio station and his small study at home. Aguilar told CPJ her husband had never had problems or received any threats. Several days after Salgado's murder, hundreds of journalists protested in the streets of Tegucigalpa. They called on local authorities to ensure justice.</p>
 <p>On October 26, authorities arrested German David Almendárez Amador after witnesses identified him as the gunman, the Tegucigalpa-based daily <em>El Heraldo</em> reported. Almendárez and his family insisted that he was innocent and had an alibi, local news reports said. He was later freed without charge after spending many months in custody.</p>

He died at the scene.</p>
 <p>Saipov, 26, covered Uzbekistan's political and social landscape for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Voice of America, and the Central Asia news Web site <em>Ferghana</em>. He had interviewed members of the banned Islamic groups Hizb-ut Tahrir and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, according to local CPJ sources. Exiled opposition activist Shakhida Yakub, who was close to Saipov, told The Associated Press that the journalist had recently become politically involved with Uzbek opposition groups.</p>
 <p>An ethnic Uzbek, Saipov lived in and reported from the southern Kyrgyz city of Osh, just across the border from the Uzbek city of Andijan. Saipov covered the aftermath of mass killings in Andijan in May 2005, when government troops shot at crowds of civilians protesting President Islam Karimov's regime. He reported on Uzbek refugees who fled and resettled in Kyrgyzstan. The Uzbek government put the Andijan death toll at 187; human rights groups say more than 700 were killed.</p>
 <p>Prior to his murder, Saipov had received anonymous threats warning him to stop his press and political activities, a local source close to the journalist told CPJ. A state television channel in the Uzbek city of Namangan had recently aired a program smearing Saipov as a provocateur who tried to destabilize Uzbekistan with his reporting. Several state publications ran similar articles, the same source told CPJ.</p>
 <p>Following the Andijan killings, Uzbekistan moved aggressively to expel, drive into exile, imprison, and harass independent journalists, human rights defenders, opposition activists, representatives of international nongovernmental groups, and witnesses. Many found refuge in neighboring Kyrgyzstan, but Uzbek security services infiltrated the area and continued harassing them there, according to human rights groups. Local press reports said that Uzbek security agents had been spotted in the heavily ethnic-Uzbek city of Osh.</p>
 <p>Saipov had helped scores of Uzbek refugees in southern Kyryzstan, assisting them with lodging and linking them with resettlement agencies, AP said. He had also reported on the fate of Uzbek refugees in Iran for <em>Ferghana</em>, the news site said.</p>

being transported by Ingushetia police following his arrest at the airport in
the regional capital, Magas. Ingushetia police immediately called the shooting
an accident, saying Yevloyev had tried to take a gun from one of the arresting
officers. Yevloyev's relatives, colleagues, and friends told CPJ they believe
he was murdered to silence the Web site, one of the few remaining independent
news sources in Ingushetia.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Yevloyev had just gotten off a flight from Moscow when he was arrested at about 1:30 p.m., according to a colleague who was
present at the scene but asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal.
Yevloyev, who lived in <st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Moscow</st1:place></st1:city>
with his family, was traveling to Ingushetia to visit with his parents and
friends. Around 20 relatives and friends had gathered at Magas airport to greet
Yevloyev.</p>

message to Magomed Khazbiyev, a friend and local opposition activist, telling
him that he had shared the flight with Ingushetia President Murat Zyazikov, the
friend told CPJ. After the presidential cortege left the airport, six armored
vehicles approached the plane, Khazbiyev said. A group of armed police officers
approached Yevloyev and placed him in a UAZ van. ""They did not handcuff him,
and he did not resist them,"" Khazbiyev told CPJ.</p>

that Ingushetia police said they had detained Yevloyev as a witness in a
criminal investigation into an August explosion at the home of a regional
administration official.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">When they saw Yevloyev had been detained, Khazbiyev said,
friends followed the vehicles in their own cars. After the police vehicles left
the airport, they split into two columns and took different directions.
Khazbiyev and Yevloyev's relatives and friends followed the group heading
toward Ingushetia's main city, Nazran. ""We followed them for about 20 minutes
until we almost reached Nazran's city limits,"" Khazbiyev told CPJ. When the
cars stopped, it became clear Yevloyev was not there. ""We have no blood on our
hands,"" one police officer told them, Khazbiyev told CPJ.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Ingushetia police said that shortly after the journalist
was placed in one of their vans, Yevloyev tried to wrestle away a gun belonging
to one of the arresting officers. The gun went off, police said, striking
Yevloyev in the temple. Police brought Yevloyev to a Nazran hospital, where he
was pronounced dead.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Vladimir Markin, a spokesman with the investigative
committee of Russia's prosecutor general's office, told journalists in
September 2008 that a criminal case has been opened and the case has been
categorized as ""murder by negligence."" The statement left unclear whether
regional or federal prosecutors would be in charge of the probe.</p>

region.&nbsp;<i style="""">Ingushetiya</i>&nbsp;had

closed because of its critical coverage. Yevloyev told CPJ that Ingushetia
authorities had launched more than a dozen lawsuits against the Web site in the

saying that authorities ""will fight organized crime or terrorism--whatever is
behind this murder--to its very end."" On November 1, Croatian police announced
that they had charged five suspects in connection with the murder.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">In addition, police spokesman Krunoslav Borovec said
investigators were working with Bosnian authorities to track down the suspect
they believe planted the bomb. Local press reports identified the suspect as
Zeljko Milovanovic, a Bosnian Serb and former member of a Serbian paramilitary
group called the Red Berets. He held both Croatian and Bosnian passports,
according to the independent Serbian broadcaster B92. According to Reuters,
Bosnian police raided Milovanovic's house in the northern Bosnian town of&nbsp;<st1:city w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Doboj</st1:place></st1:city>&nbsp;on October 31,

he told police, an unidentified assailant approached him near his apartment building,
brandished a handgun and fired, narrowly missing him, the Croatian news Web
site&nbsp;<i style="""">Javno</i>&nbsp;reported. The
assailant was not apprehended.</p>

<p>In 2009, Sreten Jocic, a member of an
organized crime group and the suspected mastermind, was charged with
involvement in Pukanic's murder. The next year, he was sentenced to 15 years in
prison for an unrelated murder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In November 2010, the
Municipal Court in Zagreb convicted five conspirators in the bombing and
sentenced them to prison terms ranging from 15 to 33 years. Milovanovic was
convicted in absentia and sentenced to a 40-year term. He was arrested in
Serbia in 2009 and tried in Belgrade on similar charges. On April 2, 2014, the Belgrade
Special Court convicted Milovanovic of planting the bomb and sentenced him to
40 years in jail. His accomplice in the case, Milenko Kuzmanovic, was handed a
five-year prison term on charges of helping Milovanovic with a forged passport,
local and international press reported. According to Reuters, the court
declared that prosecutors did not have enough evidence to prove that Jocic
ordered the murder and dropped his charges. He continues to serve a jail term
in an unrelated case.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Masked gunmen repeatedly shot Tahlil, director of the independent broadcaster HornAfrik, as he and several other senior journalists were walking through the Bakara Market area of the capital, according to CPJ interviews and news accounts.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The journalists had been summoned to a meeting with members of Al-Shabaab, a militant Islamist group that was apparently displeased with coverage of the January 31 presidential election won by Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, a moderate Islamic leader. Al-Shabaab had rejected the election and considered the newly elected leader to be a puppet of the West.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The other journalists escaped without serious injury, but Tahlil died at the scene. In a telephone interview, an Al-Shabaab spokesman denied responsibility for the murder.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">However, on March 3, 2016, a military court in Mogadishu found Hassan Hanafi, a former journalist and affiliate of the militant group Al-Shabaab, guilty of direct or indirect involvement in the murder, as well as the killings of four other journalists. <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35716567"" target=""_blank"">According to news reports</a>, the court sentenced him to death by execution, which in Somalia is usually carried out by firing squad.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">When soldiers opened fire on opposition demonstrators
marching toward the presidential palace, a bullet struck Ratovonirina in the
head, according to local journalists. The journalist was carrying a notebook
and sound equipment, according to reporter Mirindra Raparivelo, who was filming
the scene for RTA. Raparivelo recalled the hiss of bullets and the smell of
gunfire as he crawled to safety uninjured.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">At least 25 people were killed and another 167 injured in
the shootings, according to The Associated Press. The country’s defense
minister resigned to protest the shootings, while the United Nations called for
“a fair process by which those responsible will be brought to justice.”</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><p class=""MsoNormal"">The shootings came amid a deepening power

text messages on his cell phone for two weeks before he disappeared, the
director of&nbsp;<i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">Radar Bali</i>, Justin
Herman, told CPJ.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Police arrested a local politician and several accomplices in
the killing, which they said was motivated by the reporter's coverage of a local
government project, news accounts said. Police alleged that I Nyoman Susrama, a
legislative council member for the district of Bangli, a large city in
eastern&nbsp;<st1:place w:st=""on"">Bali</st1:place>, and accomplices had seized Prabangsa
from his home on February 11.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Police said the assailants took Prabangsa 30 miles (50

autopsy report cited in news stories found saltwater in the journalist's
digestive system, indicating that he may have been alive when he entered the
water. The autopsy said he also sustained head injuries and a broken wrist
before his death.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Prabangsa's reporting had exposed possible corruption in a

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Akhmedilov, known as Malik, was deputy editor of the Makhachkala-based daily <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">Hakikat</i> (The Truth) and a chief editor of the political monthly <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">Sogratl</i>, named after his native village.

The journalist was also known for his investigative reporting into the recent assassinations of Dagestani officials, the Russian service of Radio Free <st1:personname w:st=""on"">Europe</st1:personname>/Radio Liberty reported.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Gadzhiyeva, who visited the crime scene and met with Akhmedilov's wife and neighbors, said witnesses saw at least one killer in a parked Lada sedan with tinted windows and no license plates in the editor's neighborhood. When the journalist left in his car for an errand, the Lada followed and at least one gunman fired, she told CPJ.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Akhmedilov's neighbors said they had seen the same Lada parked in the neighborhood for at least two days prior to the killing, Gadzhiyeva told CPJ. Akhmedilov did not report receiving any threats, she said.</p>

spokesman told the&nbsp;Azeri Press Agency&nbsp;(APA) that&nbsp;the journalist
appeared to have suffered a stroke. Penitentiary Service representatives claimed
that Mamedov had refused a transfer to a civilian hospital for treatment.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The official statements were directly at odds with accounts
from the journalist’s lawyer and supporters.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Ramiz Mamedov (no relationship to the journalist), the
editor’s lawyer, said the journalist told him two days before his death that
medical treatment had been inadequate and his health was deteriorating. The
lawyer also told CPJ that prison authorities refused to release the journalist
on humanitarian grounds despite calls from the Council of <st1:personname w:st=""on"">Europe</st1:personname>’s representative to&nbsp;<st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:country-region w:st=""on"">Azerbaijan</st1:country-region></st1:place>&nbsp;and the country’s

prostate tumor, the lawyer said.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Emin Huseynov, director of the Baku-based Institute for
Reporters’ Freedom and Safety, told CPJ that prison authorities did not comply
with a local court’s order to provide Mamedov with medical treatment beginning
in March. He said authorities refused to allow independent medical treatment
offered by a <st1:personname w:st=""on"">Europe</st1:personname>an Union
delegation that visited the journalist in prison in June.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><p class=""MsoNormal"">Azerbaijani authorities took Mamedov into state custody in
February 2007, initially on a trumped-up charge of resisting arrest, which was
then changed to charges of state treason and incitement of ethnic hatred. A
three-month-long, closed-door trial culminated in a&nbsp;10-year jail sentence.
Authorities never disclosed their evidence against the journalist. News reports
said the case was based on an allegation that he had received money from&nbsp;<st1:country-region w:st=""on"">Iran</st1:country-region>&nbsp;to publish&nbsp;<i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Salvadoran police found Poveda's body sprawled near his car on an isolated road in the town of <st1:city w:st=""on"">Tonacatepeque</st1:city>, about 10 miles (15 kilometers) from the capital, <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">San Salvador</st1:city></st1:place>, according to local and international press reports. He had been shot in the face at least four times at close range. Authorities found an audio recorder and the journalist's press credentials at the scene.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Poveda, a 52-year-old Frenchman of Spanish descent, had documented violence in <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:country-region w:st=""on"">El Salvador</st1:country-region></st1:place> as a filmmaker and photojournalist over the course of three decades.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Throughout 2008, the journalist worked on a highly anticipated documentary about one of the country's most violent street gangs, Mara 18. During the filming, Poveda lived with gang members for 18 months. The documentary, ""La Vida Loca,"" was scheduled for wide release in September and had already been screened at international film festivals. It showed brutal killings, rites of initiation, and the judicial system's ineffectiveness in combating gangs. Local press reports said Poveda had received death threats from angry gang members.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Tonacatepeque was controlled by Mara 18, local press reports said. At the time of the murder, Poveda was reportedly traveling from nearby La Campanera, a town controlled by Mara 18's main rival, Mara Salvatrucha. Confrontations between the two gangs have been extremely violent. Witnesses said they called police to the scene of the killing after hearing several gunshots, according to local press reports.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Salvadoran President Mauricio Funes issued a statement condemning Poveda's killing and calling for an end to street violence.In September 2009, local police arrested several suspects, including reputed members of Mara 18 and a police agent according to news reports. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p>On March 9, 2011, a special tribunal for organized crime sentenced Luis Roberto Vásquez Romero and José Alejandro Melara, two high-ranking members of Mara 18 to 30 years imprisonment on charges of masterminding and carrying out Poveda's killing, according to local and international press reports. Mara member Keyri Geraldine Mayorga Álvarez was found guilty of being an accomplice and sentenced to 20 years in prison, press reports <a href=""http://www.laprensagrafica.com/el-salvador/judicial/177322-11-condenados-por-asesinato-de-poveda.html"">said</a>.</p>
<p>Eight other individuals, including seven gang members, were handed four-year sentences on charges of criminal association. The other, former police officer Juan Napoleón Espinoza Pérez, had labeled Poveda as a police informant, which was believed to have been a motivating factor in the murder, the San Salvador-based online newspaper <i>ElFaro</i> <a href=""http://www.elfaro.net/es/201103/internacionales/3712/"">reported</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Twenty other suspects tried in relation to Poveda's killing were acquitted, press reports said, although all are serving sentences in other cases, <i>ElFaro</i> reported. The attorney general's office said it would appeal the acquittals.</p>
<p>In August, 2013, three other members of Mara 18 were sentenced to 10 years in jail each for having participated in the planning of the murder, according to <a href=""http://www.lapagina.com.sv/nacionales/85973/2013/08/24/Diez-anos-de-carcel-para-implicados-en-muerte-de-Christian-Poveda"">news reports</a>.

not know the source of fire that killed the Afghan journalist. The&nbsp;<i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">Times</i>&nbsp;reported that the British
decision to attempt the rescue came after Afghan government agents learned that
the captors were planning to move the journalists into Pakistan.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The two men were abducted while covering the aftermath of a NATO raid on
two hijacked fuel tankers near Kunduz in which scores of Afghan civilians were
reportedly killed. Munadi was a well-respected Afghan reporter who had just
returned to the country for the presidential election held in August. He had
been studying in&nbsp;<st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:country-region w:st=""on"">Germany</st1:country-region></st1:place>&nbsp;for
a master’s degree in public policy and had been a long-time reporter for
the&nbsp;<i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">Times</i>&nbsp;and other
publications.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Farrell said the two were given food, water, and blankets,
and were not harmed while they were being held. But&nbsp;he said that Munadi
was taunted by the kidnappers, who told him to remember the case of Ajmal
Naqshbandi, an Afghan reporter who was beheaded after being taken by the
Taliban in&nbsp;<st1:place w:st=""on"">Helmand</st1:place>&nbsp;province in
2007.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Munadi’s remains were not recovered by the British rescue
team. British military authorities released few details about the mission and
did not respond to inquiries from CPJ seeking information about the circumstances
of his death, whether his rescue was an objective of the mission, or whether the
troops had sufficient information to identify him as one of the captives.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Anger among Afghan journalists rose in the days after
Munadi’s death. On September 13, many of his colleagues signed a letter calling
on the Afghan government to undertake “serious and thorough investigations to
identify the perpetrators of this inhumane act.”</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">In November, CPJ called on British Prime Minister Gordon
Brown to undertake a thorough investigation into the rescue mission, noting
that many questions were left unanswered in the aftermath.&nbsp;</p><p></p>",,,,,2009,AF,AF,.af,Afghanistan,afghanistan,Asia,asia,asia,Afghanistan,Confirmed

found your home. It’s over for you now.” That day, Antuna reported the attack
and the earlier threats to the state attorney general’s office, but he told
colleagues that authorities never contacted him to follow up. Records on file
at the attorney general’s office show that authorities did not take his
complaint seriously, calling Antuna “paranoid.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Ampatuan</st1:city></st1:place>.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""apple-style-span""><span style=""color:black"">A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said </span></span>most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">The entourage was on its way to <span style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"">Shariff Aguak </span>to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s decades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"">In their fact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of concerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime scene had not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still strewn about several days after the massacre. The recovery effort, which relied on the use of excavation equipment, compromised forensic evidence, it added.

He died later that day at the Uludağ University Hospital in Bursa.</p>
<p>Ümit Babacan, an editor at <em>Güney Marmara'da Yaşam</em>, told CPJ that Hayırsevener had received recent, anonymous death threats in connection with his journalism. Hayırsevener had reported on corruption charges involving the owners of <em>İlkhaber</em>, another major daily in Bandırma, the <em>Hurriyet Daily News</em> reported. Three principals in <em>İlkhaber</em> had been imprisoned on charges of accepting cash payouts from a former mayor, the paper said.

which was not immediately clear. Some local news reports said Pavlyuk intended
to start a pro-opposition online publication and had traveled to Almaty to meet
with potential partners. Other reports said Pavlyuk was on a reporting trip to
investigate a car-theft ring.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Pavlyuk, an ethnic Russian, had headed the Kyrgyz bureaus of

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Pavlyuk was found unconscious on the evening of December 16,
sprawled on the overhang of an Almaty apartment building entrance, his hands

there. A police search of a sixth-floor apartment found a roll of tape,
Pavlyuk's jacket, a key for an Almaty hotel room that he had checked into
earlier that day, and an empty laptop bag, the ministry said. </p>

One reporter, who was not identified, was abducted with Valdés but was later freed. The third colleague was not forced into the vehicle.</p>

<p>The next morning, the Coahuila attorney general's office announced that Valdés' body had been found in front of the local Motel Marbella. He had been shot several times, his arms and legs had been bound, and his body showed evidence of torture. A handwritten message found alongside his body read: ""This is going to happen to those who don't understand. The message is for everyone.""</p>

<p>The state attorney general's office told local reporters that an organized criminal group was behind the murder. Local reporters told CPJ that Valdés was most likely targeted because of a December 29, 2009, story about military raids at the Motel Marbella. The story, which ran without bylines, identified a leader of the Zetas criminal group as being arrested in one of the raids.

Palacios arrived about 10 p.m. with a cousin in the back seat of a double cabin 4-by-4 pickup, and his girlfriend, a doctor, in the passenger seat. Neighbors told local reporters that a few shots were initially fired, apparently by a lookout, followed by a fusillade of gunfire as other assailants joined in. Palacios died at the scene. Dr. Yorleny Sánchez, badly injured, died two weeks later. Palacios' cousin was not injured, local press reports said.</p>

<p>Several work-related motives emerged in a July 2010 CPJ investigation. Palacios opposed the 2009 military-backed coup that ousted President Manuel Zelaya, and he had turned the TV station into an openly opposition channel, his colleagues said. Military personnel appeared at his house and detained him and his family for several hours in June 2009. That episode, along with other threats from the military, was strong enough that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights issued an order to the government of Honduras to protect Palacios. According to the commission, it was one of more than 400 such orders issued for journalists and activists in Honduras in 2009 and 2010. </p>

<p>The Honduran government was required by an international treaty to follow the directives, but it appeared to have ignored most of them. The government asserted that it never received an order in the Palacios case, although the Inter-American Commission noted that it had a signed receipt from the Honduran Supreme Court.</p>

<p>In the months before his slaying, Palacios campaigned on behalf of a group of several thousand peasants who had been demanding vast tracts of land they said rightfully belonged to them. They claimed that a few large landowners, in violation of agrarian reform laws, had greatly underpaid them for land many years earlier. Some of the land was retaken by the peasants--simply stolen, according to the landowners--and there were occasional armed encounters. Peasant activists said some of their leaders had been abducted and disappeared, or singled out and killed.</p>

<p>Aside from the wide belief that Palacios' killing was politically inspired, some CPJ sources said he could have angered a local drug gang with a recent news story about a cartel-linked kidnapping. Sources also said that Palacios, like other Tocoa journalists, had been accused of extorting money from sources. Palacios' father, José Heriberto Palacios denied his son could have been dishonest. ""They killed him because he was honest and was not corrupt,"" he told CPJ.</p>

<p>The case was marked by a series of investigative failures. Almost three months after Palacios was gunned down, a team of investigators came to his grave in his hometown of Rigores, dug up his body, and at the graveside, in the open, conducted an autopsy. The coroner never examined the body after the murder; it had gone straight from the murder scene to the funeral home. Investigators also started asking news photographers if they had any pictures of the crime scene because police had no photographs of their own. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Arody Reyes, conceded to CPJ that though the gunmen had lain in wait for hours at Palacios' house, police had not been able to retrieve any evidence from the scene.</p>

<p>Reyes said the exhumation and autopsy were suddenly important because the Honduran government had enlisted the help of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. Local investigators, Reyes said, needed to show their U.S. counterparts something.</p>",,,,,2010,HO,HN,.hn,Honduras,honduras,Americas,americas,americas,Honduras,Confirmed

A second man picked up the attacker and they reportedly fled on a motorcycle. Castilla died at the scene.</p>

<p>Castilla, who also contributed to the local radio station La Voz de Montería, had received threats for at least four years in relation to his coverage of links between local politicians, landowners, and illegal right-wing paramilitary groups, local journalists told CPJ. In July 2008, the journalist testified before the Colombian Supreme Court on links between members of the National Congress and paramilitary groups.</p>

<p>Shortly before his death, Castilla covered a court ruling against the owner of the Montería newspaper <i>El Meridiano</i> in a land dispute case, according to the national daily <i>El Tiempo</i>. The daily said the journalist had also reported on allegedly unlawful use of state funds in 2006 congressional political campaigns.</p>

<p>The government provided protection to Castilla from 2006 to 2009 because of threats against his life, the local Foundation for Freedom of the Press (FLIP) said. In November 2009, the Ministry of Interior withdrew the protection based on an intelligence review that indicated Castilla was no longer under threat, according to FLIP.</p>

<p>Local authorities did not disclose possible motives or suspects, according to local press reports.

He had been arrested in February based on a criminal complaint from top presidential aide Laurent Esso.</p>

<p>The case began when Ngota and journalists with three other publications jointly sent a series of questions to Esso, secretary-general of the presidency and chairman of the state-run oil company SNH, along with a copy of a document that had been leaked to them. Their questions centered on whether 1.3 billion CFA francs (US$2.6 million) had been improperly paid to three SNH managers as ""commissions"" in the purchase of an offshore service ship, according to news reports and CPJ interviews. The accompanying document purported to be a June 2008 confidential memorandum signed by Esso that described the payments. (Esso did not publicly comment on the allegations and did not respond to CPJ's requests for a response.)</p>

<p>On February 5, intelligence agents arrested Ngota along with Harrys Robert Mintya of the weekly Le Devoir, Serge Sabouang of the bimonthly La Nation, and reporter Simon Hervé Nko'o of the weekly Bebela. Agents with the Directorate-General of External Intelligence pressed the journalists for their source of the 2008 memo, holding them each for several days, the journalists later told colleagues. By February 25, news reports said, judicial police had charged the journalists with falsifying a government document. Nko'o had gone into hiding by that time, but the others were rearrested and sent to Kondengui Prison.</p> 

<p>Ngota died on April 22 from ""abandonment, improper care"" and the authorities' ""failure to render assistance,"" according to a prison doctor's initial death certificate, which his family shared with local journalists. A 15-year veteran of the press, Ngota was the first journalist to lose his life in the line of duty in Cameroon since CPJ began documenting media casualties in 1992.</p> 

<p>CPJ and other groups immediately called for an independent investigation into the death. President Paul Biya did order a judicial police inquiry ""independent of the executive"" but appeared to immediately predetermine its result. Biya asserted the case was ""not a matter of restriction of freedom of the press,"" according to news reports, and that Ngota had died of poor health. The ensuing government inquiry was riddled with irregularities.</p>

<p>Just two days after Biya's announcement, Communications Minister Issa Tchoroma Bakary said Ngota had tested positive for HIV and had died from its complications--a claim disputed by Ngota's widow. Tchoroma said the findings were based on a second medical examination of Ngota's body, which he said had been held in the presence of the journalist's family--a claim denied by Ngota's brother, Bruno Ntede, according to Agence France-Presse. Félix Cyriaque Ebolé Bola, a local journalist invited by the government to be an independent witness at the examination, told CPJ that he had been given the wrong address and didn't make it to the exam.</p>

<p>In September, Justice Minister Amadou Ali presented the findings of his agency's inquiry into the death, which absolved authorities of any responsibility.

gunfire on the morning of May 19 while reporting on military operations to
dislodge anti-government demonstrators from an elaborate protest site, a CPJ
investigation found. He was one of two foreign journalists killed during
violent political unrest that gripped the capital for several weeks. Hiro
Muramoto, a Japanese cameraman for Reuters, was killed in crossfire in April.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Bradley Cox, a Bangkok-based documentary filmmaker, said
that earlier on the morning of May 19, troops fired sporadically from behind a
barricade into areas 200 meters away that were controlled by red-shirted protesters
for the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship, or UDD. Cox,
interviewed for a CPJ special report, said both he and Polenghi had taken
footage of a protester shot in the leg around 10:45 a.m.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">About 15 minutes later, Cox said, sensing a lull in the
shooting, he moved away from a barricade controlled by the UDD and into a nearly
empty road to investigate a commotion among protesters approximately 30 to 40
meters away. Cox said Polenghi followed a few steps behind. While running down
the road, Cox felt a sudden, sharp pain in the side of his leg. It turned out
that a bullet had grazed his knee, causing minor injury. When he turned to look
back in the direction of the troops, he saw Polenghi sprawled on the ground
about two or three meters behind him. Polenghi was wearing a blue helmet with
the word ""Press"" written across the front and back, and a green armband
indicating that he was a working journalist.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">""My feeling at the time was that we were shot at the exact
same time, perhaps even with the same bullet,"" said Cox, adding that he didn't
hear the gunshot or shots that hit him or Polenghi. ""I don't know who shot me
or Fabio, but if the military was trying to shoot red shirts, there was no one
around us. ... Soldiers were firing at anything or anybody.""</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Video footage Cox subsequently took of journalists and
protesters who carried Polenghi's body out of the road and onto a motorcycle
bound for a nearby local hospital appeared to show a bullet had entered
Polenghi's body under his left armpit and exited through his side. He was
declared dead on arrival at a local hospital, according to news reports.
Authorities did not report any bullet being recovered.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Polenghi's family expressed concerns about the government's
opaque investigation into the death. His sister, Elisabetta Polenghi, noted
that many of his belongings, including his camera and telephone, were missing.
She and a group of Polenghi's colleagues pieced together video clips--some
received from journalists who were in Polenghi's vicinity, others downloaded
from unknown sources on the Internet--to develop a timeline of movements before
and after the shooting. There was no known footage of the shooting itself. One
video clip showed that an unidentified man wearing a silver helmet was the
first to reach Polenghi after he was shot. The brief footage showed him feeling
around Polenghi's chest and briefly jostling with his camera, while another
unidentified man wearing a yellow helmet knelt and took a photograph.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Government spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn did not respond
to questions from CPJ on the Polenghi shooting, including the assertion that
soldiers had been firing indiscriminately.</p>",,,,,2010,TH,TH,.th,Thailand,thailand,Asia,asia,asia,Thailand,Confirmed

Gomes, 46, at least five times in front of his home in the Paraíba neighborhood
of Caicó, Rio Grande do Norte state, news reports said. The journalist, shot
around 9 p.m., was pronounced dead at a local hospital.</p>

<p>Gomes, news director of local
broadcaster Radio Caicó, had reported on a variety of local topics, including
government corruption, crime, and drug trafficking, according to local news
accounts. He also published stories on a personal blog. In September, Gomes
broke a story on vote-tampering in Rio Grande do Norte while covering the
Brazilian general elections. The story, which described local politicians
buying votes in exchange for crack cocaine, was picked up nationwide, according
to <i>Portal Imprensa</i>, a Sao Paulo-based news site focused on press issues.
Soon after the piece aired, Gomes received anonymous death threats, news
reports said.</p>

<p>The day after the murder, state
police arrested a man identified as João Francisco dos Santos, also known as ""Dão,""
local news media reported. Police said dos Santos had admitted killing Gomes in
reprisal for the reporter's coverage of his 2007 armed robbery conviction.
Despite the suspect's reported statement, state police said they were still
investigating the case and had not ruled out further leads. In an interview
with the Natal-based daily <i>Tribuna do Norte</i>, state prosecutor Geraldo
Rufino said he believed that dos Santos was a hired assassin. Brazilian media
quoted Gomes' relatives and friends as saying they believed drug traffickers
had ordered the killing.</p>

<p>In December, investigators said dos
Santos had been hired by Vladir Souza do Nascimento, a convicted felon serving
a prison sentence for drug trafficking. News reports quoted investigators as
saying that Gomes' coverage had hindered criminal activities being run by Souza
from prison. Prosecutors requested that Souza be prosecuted for masterminding
the murder, news accounts said.</p>

<p>In 2011 and 2012, authorities also accused a group of local men of having
ordered, planned, and carried out the crime. The individuals, reports said, had
grievances with Gomes in relation to his coverage of local crime, corruption,
and drug trafficking. Police charged a businessman, Lailson Lopes, known as
""Gordo da Rodoviária,"" as the mastermind of the crime. Lopes was
indicted and awaited trial. Four other men, including a local army lieutenant
colonel, military police officer, lawyer and a former pastor who was serving a
jail sentence for drug trafficking, were charged and awaiting trial, according
to <a href=""http://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/ultimas-noticias/2012/05/09/morte-de-jornalista-do-rio-grande-do-norte-foi-encomendada-e-custou-r-8000-diz-policia.htm"">news

Ortega, 47, had recently received death threats from an unknown source, according to The Associated Press. The journalist had openly criticized local officials accused of corruption and had opposed provincial mining projects, news reports said.</p>
<p>In a departure from most journalist murder investigations in the Philippines, police moved quickly in the case, arresting Marlon Recamata, the alleged gunman, and several suspected accomplices. Recamata pleaded guilty in February 2011 and was sentenced to life in prison in May 2013. Recamata told the court he was paid the equivalent of US$250 for the slaying, according to news reports and the victim's family.</p>
<p>An accomplice, Rodolfo Edrad, identified ex-Palawan provincial governor, Joel Reyes, and his brother, Mario Reyes, former mayor of the resort town of Coron in northern Palawan, as having ordered the murder in retaliation for Ortega's reporting on local mining operations. A Department of Justice panel had dismissed murder charges against the Reyes brothers in 2011, but a second panel reversed that decision in March 2013, based on new evidence. The following month, an appellate court blocked efforts by the Department of Justice to arrest the Reyeses, saying the department was over-reaching, according to news reports. While the department appealed, the brothers went into hiding.</p>
<p>The case has been marred in other respects. In February 2013, an accomplice who became a prosecution witness was found dead in his prison cell in Lucena City, Quezon. Prison authorities said Dennis Aranas had hanged himself, but an investigation by the public attorney's office found fingernail marks and other injuries that indicated he had likely been attacked.</p>
<p>Police in Phuket, Thailand arrested both Reyes brothers, both of whom were traveling on fake passports, for overstaying their visas. They were deported to the Philippines, where they were held in detention, according to news reports. In January 2016, the Supreme Court ruled that there was probable cause for their arrest, and returned jurisdiction for the case to Palawan's Regional Trial Court. In March 2016, Arturo ""Nonoy"" Regalado, a former aide to the governor, was found guilty by the court for his role in Ortega's assassination and sentenced to 40 years in prison.</p>
<p>In a controversial decision, the regional court granted bail to Mario Reyes in May 2016, but later in the year rejected a similar petition for Joel Reyes. Both politicians ran for elected office from prison but lost their respective bids for the vice-mayoralty and mayoralty of Coron on May 9, according to news reports. The murder trial was still in progress in late 2016.</p>",,,,,2011,RP,PH,.ph,Philippines,philippines,Asia,asia,asia,Philippines,Confirmed

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

Libya to cover the conflict as a freelancer. He was working on the front lines

Manuel Varela (also known as Manu Brabo)--when they came under fire from
government forces. Hammerl was shot in the abdomen, and Gillis, Foley, and

for persons reported missing as a result of fighting and provide family members
with any information it had. Hammerl's family had repeatedly sought information
about his whereabouts.

traveled to Tunisia

International efforts were ultimately successful in gaining the release of the
detained journalists, but the South African government appeared to have played
no part. When South African President Jacob Zuma visited Tripoli on April 10 and 11, he failed to
bring up Hammerl's case, according to media reports.

threats from intelligence officials in recent months.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Shahzad was reported missing after he failed to show up for
a televised panel discussion in Islamabad. He was scheduled to discuss his
recent article for Asia Times Online in which he reported that Al-Qaeda, having
infiltrated the Pakistani Navy, was behind a 17-hour siege at a naval base in
Karachi on May 22. He said the attack came after military or security officials
refused to release a group of naval officials suspected of being linked to
militant groups. The attack, coming soon after the U.S. killing of Osama bin
Laden on May 2, was deeply embarrassing to the Pakistani military. Earlier in
May, three navy buses carrying recruits were blown up via remote control
devices in Karachi, the large port city where the navy has its headquarters. <o:p></o:p></p>

had been warned by intelligence agents to stop reporting on sensitive security
matters. In October 2010, Shahzad told Ali Dayan Hasan, a researcher for Human

meeting at the headquarters of the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate in
Rawalpindi. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Filgueira, 36, was the founder and
director of the local newspaper <i>Jornal
o Serrano</i>. He was also the regional director of the ruling Workers Party
(PT) and wrote a blog in which he criticized political adversaries. According
to local <a href=""http://portalimprensa.uol.com.br/noticias/brasil/39860/grupo+acusado+de+matar+jornalista+e+preso+no+rn/"">press
reports</a>, Filgueira had
recently published a critical poll on the performance of the local government
on his blog, after which he received death threats.</p>

<p>On July 2, a joint force of federal and
local police arrested several suspects who they said belonged to a gang of
contract killers. They also seized weapons and large quantities of ammunition
in the arrests. Federal police chief Marcelo Mosele confirmed to CPJ at the
time that they had ruled out other possibilities and were exclusively focusing
on Filgueira's journalistic work as the motive for the crime.</p>

<p>On December 5, 2013, seven men were
convicted of planning and participating in the crime, including the gunman, and
received sentences ranging from 19 to 23 years in prison, according to <a href=""http://g1.globo.com/rn/rio-grande-do-norte/noticia/2013/12/juri-condena-acusados-da-morte-de-dirigente-do-pt-em-serra-do-mel-rn.html"">news reports</a>. One of the men, who is considered a fugitive, was sentenced
in absentia. Josivan Bibiano, who was mayor of Serro do Mel at the time of
Filgueira's death, was charged with being the mastermind of the crime but, after
being jailed twice, was released, according to news
reports. There has been no movement in his case since. A blog set up in remembrance of Filguiera <a href=""http://fundacaoedinaldofilgueira.blogspot.com/"">reported</a><span style=""color:#111111;background:white""> that
Bibiano is the cousin of three of the convicted men.</span></p>

Filguiera was killed because he had been denouncing corruption in the city
government. </p>

José de Oliveira Ferreira, a cousin of Filguiera's who had traveled to Serro
do Mel from Sao Paulo to participate in the sentencing hearing, was <a href=""http://www.patrulhadorn.com/?p=4398"">murdered</a> by unidentified gunmen. No motive has

him. His pleading fell on deaf ears.""</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The day after the murder, police investigator Gerald Mark
Oliver Jubelag told local reporters that Guarin was hit six times by bullets
fired from a .45 caliber handgun. Jubelag said the two assailants were unmasked
and fled the scene of the crime on a white Honda XRM motorcycle. The Associated
Press&nbsp;quoted Fred Solinap, Guarin's co-anchor in their program on herbal
medicine, as saying that Guarin was puzzled by a text message he got during
their radio broadcast on the day of his murder. The message, which Guarin read
on air, warned him in the local dialect not to leave the station or he would be
killed.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p></o:p></p>

report on the murder released later in the year identified Palabrica's
accomplice as Eddie Labajo.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p></o:p></p>

both suspects from closed-circuit footage of a separate murder they had
allegedly committed in July 2011.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The NBI report said that although a motive had not been
established, authorities had inferred from the evidence that the murder was
linked to Guarin's newspaper&nbsp;<i>Tatak</i>. The report said that Guarin's
newspaper and radio programs also frequently endorsed products made by AG
Global Pharma. The Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility said that a
rival company, selling similar products and promoting them over different local
media, could have been behind the murder.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p></o:p></p>

wife was unharmed.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Police arrested Noppadon Praisri, a mini-bus operator, in
the southern town of Cha-am on January 17 after the motorcycle used in the
crime was found abandoned in a Phuket city canal, news reports said. Noppadon
told police he was paid 50,000 baht to drive the motorcycle, and identified the
alleged gunman as Sanya Klinchum.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Phuket Police Maj. Gen. Chanasit Wattanawarangkul was quoted
in local press reports as saying that investigators had sought arrest warrants
for Sanya, along with two individuals accused of plotting the killing: Somkuan
Deepan and Assadakorn Sidokbuab. News reports described Assadakorn as a Chamber
of Commerce official and owner of KPP Cable TV. No arrests were immediately
made, according to the reports.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Chanasit said that Wisut was likely targeted for his
critical reporting. Wisut had reported on a series of controversial land claims
for <i>Inside Phuket</i>. He was also a political activist with the United
Front Against Dictatorship for Democracy, which is aligned with Thailand's
ruling Peua Thai political party.&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p></o:p></p></p>",,,,,2012,TH,TH,.th,Thailand,thailand,Asia,asia,asia,Thailand,Confirmed

service of the U.S. government-funded Voice of America, at a mosque in
Shabqadar, north of Peshawar. The assailants, who struck during evening
prayers, shot Aatif multiple times before fleeing on motorcycles, police told
reporters. Aatif died of his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar. An
imam was injured in the attack.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Taliban spokesmen spoke to several news outlets, taking
responsibility for the killing. Ihsanullah Ihsan told The Associated Press that
Aatif had been warned ""a number of times to stop anti-Taliban reporting, but he
didn't do so. He finally met his fate.""<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Several CPJ sources said they were skeptical Aatif had been
killed on the orders of the Taliban or for the publicly stated reasons. Aatif
told friends and relatives that he started receiving threats from military and
intelligence officials immediately after covering a November 2011 attack by
U.S.-led NATO forces on Pakistani army check posts at Salala, near the border
with Afghanistan. Twenty-four Pakistani soldiers died in the attack. Aatif
filed reports on the attack for Deewa Radio and took part in what are called
two-ways, which are live exchanges with the station's studio journalists. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Aatif had spoken to local residents who said a Taliban
hideout was just two kilometers from the army check posts, a tribal area
journalist told CPJ. The Taliban's proximity to the army posts was highly
sensitive information because it could have provided justification for the
American attack. An official with the U.S. National Security Council told CPJ
that a Special Forces team launched the attack after taking fire from the area
of the Pakistani check posts. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Deewa Radio said Aatif's reports explained the geography of
the area but did not mention the Taliban. Deewa did not respond to CPJ's
repeated queries seeking information on what was said by the station's studio
journalists during their live two-way exchanges with Aatif. Deewa said no
archive of Aatif's reports was available. Multiple CPJ sources in Pakistan and
the United States said the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate was believed
to be behind the murder. A Pakistani security official said the speculation was
unsubstantiated.<o:p></o:p></p><p></p><p></p>",,,,,2012,PK,PK,.pk,Pakistan,pakistan,Asia,asia,asia,Pakistan,Confirmed

intense shelling by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Al-Sayed was a videographer whose work appeared on a
live-streaming site and was picked up by international and regional news
organizations. He had transmitted videos of events in the Homs neighborhood of
Baba Amr to the live-streaming site Bambuser, and had uploaded hundreds of
videos to his <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/syriapioneer"">YouTube
channel</a>. His footage was used by several news organizations, news reports
said.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">By controlling local news reports and expelling or denying
entry to dozens of international journalists, the Syrian government had sought
to impose a blackout on independent news coverage after the country's uprising
began in early 2011. In the face of this attempted news blackout, international
media relied heavily on footage shot by citizen journalists such as al-Sayed.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">By controlling local news reports and expelling or denying

smuggled themselves into Syria to cover the conflict. In her last article for
the <i>Times</i>, Colvin <a href=""http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/public/news/article874796.ece"">wrote</a>

<p>Martínez had worked for the national magazine <i>Proceso</i> for more than 10 years and was known for her in-depth reporting on drug cartels and the links between organized crime and government officials. In the week before her murder, she covered the arrest of an allegedly high-ranking leader of the Zetas; the arrests of nine police officers charged with working for a cartel; and the story of a local mayor who was arrested with other alleged cartel gunmen after a shootout with the Mexican Army, according to news reports.</p>
<p>Martínez' colleagues said she had not told them about any threats prior to her death. Two days after the murder, a state spokesperson, Gina Domínguez, <a href=""http://www.radioformula.com.mx/notas.asp?Idn=240667"">said</a> that authorities would look into Martínez' journalism as a possible motive.</p>
<p>Since Martínez's death, <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">Proceso</i> has alleged that the most likely motive for her murder was the journalist's critical reporting on state officials. Officials have denied the claim.</p>
<p>The office of the state governor, Javier Duarte de Ochoa, ordered a special group of agents to investigate the murder. <i>Proceso</i> <a href=""http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=305845"">stated</a> on its website that the state government had granted the magazine staff access to any information resulting from the investigation. The magazine also said that its executives had told the governor they were skeptical that the investigation would succeed because of the systemic dysfunction in the country.</p>
<p>In November 2012, the state attorney general announced that Jorge Antonio Hernández Silva had confessed and that robbery was the motive. But in his first court appearance, Hernández claimed he had been tortured and his family threatened if he did not make a false confession. Hernández was <a href=""/2013/04/journalist-threatened-after-reporting-on-murder-in.php"">convicted</a> in April 2013 and sentenced to 38 years in prison, but four months later judges voted to <a href=""http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2013/08/08/tribunal-revoca-la-sentencia-de-inculpado-por-la-muerte-de-regina-martinez"">vacate</a> the sentence, citing irregularities.</p>
<p>In April, <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">Proceso</i> reported a plot by officials in the government of Veracruz to harm Jorge Carrasco, senior editor with the magazine, who had reported extensively on Martínez's murder. A source close to the case who asked to remain anonymous told CPJ that there had been a plan under way to kill Carrasco, and that men were looking for him in Mexico City. Carrasco went into hiding with federal government protection. <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">Proceso</i> later published a letter from the Veracruz state attorney general's office, calling the accusations ""unfounded.""</p>
<p>While Governor Duarte made efforts in public statements to cast the state as a safe place for the press, under his tenure Veracruz became one of the most dangerous states for journalists in Mexico. At least eight journalists had been murdered since he took office in late 2010, and many more fled--permanently or temporarily--not only because of threats from organized crime but also from state government officials, according to CPJ research.</p>",,,,,2012,MX,MX,.mx,Mexico,mexico,Americas,americas,americas,Mexico,Confirmed

Sheikha Hussein of Hassan's murder and sentenced him to death. Adan was accused
of being a member of Al-Shabaab. A court rejected his appeal in July and upheld
the death penalty, according to news reports and local journalists. A firing

<p>Police arrested Beheshti on October 30 on allegations of ""acting against national security,"" and held him temporarily at Tehran's Evin Prison, Prosecutor Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejehi told the media in a weekly press conference on November 12, the state-supported Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA) <a href=""http://isna.ir/fa/news/91082214138/%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%A7%DA%98%D9%87-%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%BE%D8%B2%D8%B4%DA%A9%DB%8C-%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86%DB%8C-%D9%86%DA%AF%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%87-%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D9%87%D8%B4%D8%AA%DB%8C"">reported</a>. The <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/2012/11/121108_l21_majilis_webloger_prison.shtml"">BBC Persian service</a>, citing an unnamed source, said Beheshti was transferred from Evin to an unknown location on November 1. The blogger died two days later.</p>
<p>A press conference was held six days after reformist news websites initially reported Beheshti's death and international human rights and press freedom groups pressured the government to explain the circumstances of the blogger's death. In the press conference, Ejehi confirmed that Beheshti died in cyber police custody on November 3, according to ISNA. Ejehi said that the coroner's office had provided a detailed report, saying wounds were found in five places on Beheshti's body, including his hand, foot, back, and thigh, but that he had no fractures in his skull or any broken bones and that the doctor at Evin had said Beheshti was ""extremely exhausted,"" ISNA reported.</p>
<p>On November 6, authorities told Beheshti's family to claim his body from the Kahrizak Medical Examiner's Office and warned them not speak to the media, the reformist news website <i>Kaleme</i> reported.</p>
<p>Beheshti is believed to have died from suspected torture, news reports said. On November 10, <i>Kaleme</i> <a href=""http://www.kaleme.com/1391/08/20/klm-119438/"">published</a> a letter signed by 41 political prisoners in Evin Prison that said Beheshti's body bore signs of torture and that he was beaten during interrogation, repeatedly threatened with death, and hung from his limbs from the ceiling. On November 8, <i>Kaleme</i> <a href=""http://www.kaleme.com/1391/08/18/klm-119178/"">published</a> a letter the website said came from the blogger in which he wrote that he had been subjected to ""physical and verbal abuse"" during his interrogations. The letter also said that any confessions he may have made were untrue and extracted under torture, the website reported.</p>
<p>Beheshti had written critical articles about the regime on his <a href=""http://magalh91.blogspot.com/"">blog</a>, <i>Magalh 91</i>, which specifically accused Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and other high-ranking officials of poor policy decisions, corruption, and other abuses. In one of his last blog posts before his arrest, Beheshti said he faced constant harassment and threats from the security services. ""Yesterday they threatened me, saying I should tell my mother that she would soon be wearing black clothes if I did not shut up,"" he wrote on his blog.</p>
<p>Iran's parliament announced on November 11 that they would fully investigate Beheshti's death. The government-owned news website <i>Iran Network</i> said that three of Beheshti's interrogators had been arrested, <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/12/iran-prosecutor-confirms-blogger-death"">news reports</a> said.</p>",,,,,2012,IR,IR,.ir,Iran,iran,Middle East,mideast,mideast,Iran,Confirmed

<p>Ghazzoul was in the Student Union on the campus of the university
when he was targeted in an attack by students loyal to Bashar al-Assad's
regime, according to SCM and Frontline Defenders. The journalist was known for
reporting on abuses against journalists by al-Assad's government and for
documenting the killing and imprisonment of SCM journalists, according to Ghazzoul's
uncle, Tawfik Halaaq, who spoke to SCM. The students beat Ghazzoul repeatedly
and then handed him over to security forces who imprisoned him. </p>

<p>Security forces imprisoned Ghazzoul at the Air Force Intelligence
Base, a prison in the Damascus suburb of Mezze, where he died four days later,
according to an SCM member who spoke to Ghazzoul's cell mate in prison. The
journalist never received treatment for his injuries.</p>

<p>SCM has been instrumental in documenting the deaths and detentions
of journalists after the popular uprising began in March 2011. The group's work
is picked up by international and regional news outlets such as Al-Jazeera and
Al-Arabiya and human rights and press freedom groups. </p>

said Silva had been covering an army investigation into the theft of gasoline from
a government petroleum company in the town of Tehuacán. Theft of gasoline from
government pipelines is common in the area, which is controlled by organized
crime groups, according to local journalists.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#111111"">After leaving the scene, Silva called Rodríguez
to say he had seen an armed stand-off between soldiers at a nearby roadblock
and gunmen in an SUV and a Ford Lobo pickup truck, she said. It was unclear if
the confrontation was related to the gasoline theft. She said that Silva told
her that he had found something very important at the scene of the theft but
would explain later. Six minutes later, Rodríguez said, she heard from police
reports that a man had been shot at that location.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#111111"">The motive for the killings was not immediately
clear, although journalists speculated that it could have been related to
Silva's reporting on the series of gasoline thefts or because he could have
identified the gunmen in the stand-off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=""color:#111111"">Local reporters told CPJ that the presence of
organized crime groups has made journalists extremely cautious about what they
cover, fearing retaliation if their coverage angers the criminals. They said

<p>Hassan Shahin, an activist who was at the scene, told Abou Deif's family and the prosecutor's office that someone he knew to be a Muslim Brotherhood supporter from prior demonstrations had focused a laser penlight on Abou Deif shortly before the shooting. The laser pen </span><a href=""http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/61677/Egypt/Politics-/Islamist-activist-discharged-after-Tahrir-Square-b.aspx"">tactic</a> had been used by Muslim Brotherhood supporters and police during protests to identify activists for harassment or attack, according to news accounts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Abou Deif had shot video showing Muslim Brotherhood supporters </span><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/11/world/middleeast/allies-of-egypts-morsi-beat-protesters-outside-palace.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"">assaulting anti-government protesters</span></a>, a colleague, Hossam Sioufi, told CPJ. (A number of reporters and others later published </span></span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JChvR1sU3TY"">videos</span></a> showing Muslim Brotherhood supporters beating, intimidating, and detaining protesters that day.) Abou Deif was himself struck by a rubber bullet, suffering minor injuries, earlier in the day. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Abou Deif's family and colleagues told CPJ they believed the journalist was likely targeted by the Muslim Brotherhood, and that one of his recent articles may have provided further motive. Four months earlier, Abou Deif had written a piece that said President </span>Mohamed Morsi had included a brother-in-law in a mass July 2012 </span>presidential pardon that encompassed 572 people. Morsi's brother-in-law, Mahmoud Aly, had been serving a three-year sentence on a bribery conviction. </span></span>Morsi didn't publicly respond to About Deif's report. Soon after, Abou Deif told his brother, Salem, and several colleagues that he was being followed on the streets and was receiving threats on his Facebook page from people he identified as Muslim Brotherhood supporters, according to CPJ interviews.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The subsequent investigation and the government's response were marked by irregularities. In January 2013, Morsi spokesman Yassir Ali disputed any Muslim Brotherhood connection to the killing. In a </span><a href=""http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-01-16/opinions/36384572_1_pro-morsi-egyptian-media-protesters"">letter</span></a> to the <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">Washington Post</i>, he said ""forensic reports confirmed that Abu Deif was killed by the same type of bullet that killed seven pro-Morsi protesters at the same demonstrations.""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But the government's forensic report had not been issued at that point. It was released more than a month later, in February 2013, and was notable for what it did not include. </span>The Forensics Administration said it had not received an investigative memorandum from police, a key document that would typically include witness testimony and other details from the scene. The memorandum, which investigators are normally obligated to file in such cases, would ordinarily be used by the Forensics Administration to help determine the source and distance of the shot and other salient circumstances that would guide the prosecutor in pursuing charges. As it was, the </span>report referred only vaguely to the distance at which the shot was fired, saying it came from ""more than a meter"" away,"" and did not specify the type of weapon or bullet used, although it described the slug as having </span>expanded after entering Abou Deif's skull.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Statements from witnesses such as Shahin and <a href=""http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/syndicate-challenges-forensic-report-journalist-s-death"">pressure</span></a> from the Egyptian Journalists' Syndicate prompted authorities in April 2013 to summon three Muslim Brotherhood youth leaders for six hours of questioning. The accused were </span><a href=""http://www.masrawy.com/news/Cases/General/2013/April/6/5580111.aspx"">released</span></a> for lack of evidence. The suspects were publicly identified as Ahmed Sibia, Abdel Rahman Ezz, and Ahmed al-Moghier. Sibia was also the director of Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa television office in Cairo. The three </span><a href=""http://www.ikhwanonline.com/Article.aspx?ArtID=144862&amp;SecID=230"">denied</span></a> involvement in the killing and said their own lives had been threatened by opposition activists, according to </span></span><a href=""http://www.almesryoon.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A9/161005-%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%88-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%A3%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%89-%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%88-%D8%B6%D9%8A%D9%81-%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%84%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%84"">news reports</span></a>.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The same month, Abou Deif's family hired </span>Fakhry Saleh, former head of the Forensics Administration, to conduct its own investigation. Saleh, using the official medical report and eyewitness testimony, </span>concluded that a gunman fired one shot at close range using a ""dumdum"" bullet designed to expand on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_ballistics"" title=""Terminal ballistics"">impact</span></a> to intensify the injury.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The public prosecutor's office </span><a href=""http://tahrirnews.com/news/view.aspx?cdate=28052013&amp;id=685e2feb-9f81-45b8-af0f-51a39a476ed7"">reopened</span></a> the investigation in late May--only to close the case a month later with the vague explanation that it could not identify the ""original killer."" The office referred al-Moghier for trial on charges of torturing and detaining opposition protesters during the same clashes in which Abou Deif was killed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">After Morsi's ouster in July 2013, the prosecutor general's office asked a Cairo judge to examine the case independently, a step that encouraged </span>Abou Deif's family and lawyers. <o:p></o:p></p>",,,,,2012,EG,EG,.eg,Egypt,egypt,Middle East,mideast,mideast,Egypt,Confirmed

55, the former editor of the independent newspaper <i>Khimkinskaya Pravda</i> in
the Moscow suburb of Khimki, <a href=""http://www.interfax.ru/russia/txt.asp?id=300240"">died</a> in a Moscow hospital from heart failure stemming from a
choking episode during lunch, Elena Kostyuchenko, Beketov's friend and a
reporter for the newspaper <i>Novaya Gazeta</i>, told CPJ by
phone.</p>

<p>The
choking incident was directly related to a November 2008 assault on Beketov,
which left him in a coma for several months, according to Kostyuchenko and news
reports. When he was in the coma, surgeons maintained his breathing by inserting
a tube during a tracheotomy. Kostyuchenko said the combination of the deep
tracheal scars and the food led to him choking, which blocked airflow to his
lungs and in turn led to heart failure. </p>

<p>In
November 2008, neighbors had found Beketov lying in his front yard in Khimki,
more than 24 hours after unidentified assailants crushed his skull, broke his
legs, smashed both hands, and left him to die in the cold. Physicians removed
part of Beketov's brain after the attack, and amputated a leg as well as some
fingers, according to news reports. The journalist regularly visited the
hospital for checkups.</p>

<p>Prior
to the attack, Beketov had publicly accused Vladimir Strelchenko, then the
mayor of Khimki, of nepotism and corruption and had heavily criticized his
administration's decision to replace parts of a local forest with a freeway. </p>

<p>Yevgeniya
Chirikova, a local environmental activist and contributor to <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">Khimkinskaya Pravda</i>, told CPJ that
Beketov had received multiple threats in connection to his work. She said that
unknown men had approached and told him, ""You're due for a hit."" In May 2007,
unknown attackers firebombed Beketov's car, and killed his dog, Chirikova told
CPJ.</p>

<p>Authorities,
including Russian President <a href=""/blog/2013/04/beketovs-untimely-death-and-putins-unfulfilled-pro.php"">Vladimir Putin</a>, promised to
bring his attackers to justice but investigators failed to name or arrest anyone
in connection with the assault. Instead, two years after the attack, the

The congressman said that Carvalho had apparently told people he knew who had murdered Neto, but did not offer further details.</p>
<p>Neto had covered police corruption throughout his career, and had frequently received threats, especially for his coverage of cases in which police officers were suspected of being involved in local murders. <i>Vale do Aço </i><a href=""http://www.jvaonline.com.br/novo_site/ler_noticia.php?id=103964"">reported</a> that Carvalho also did photography work for the local police. </p>
<p>Fernando Benedito Jr., a local journalist and friend of Neto, told CPJ in an email, ""Like Rodrigo, he [Carvalho] knew too much.""</p>
<p>In the weeks after the murder, Minas Gerais state police chief Cylton Brandão announced a shuffling of law enforcement leadership and, while he said police couldn't yet confirm that the two journalist murders were linked, acknowledged the possibility of police involvement.</p>
<p>In late April, authorities announced that several police officers had been placed in preventative detention in connection with one of the murder cases that Neto had been investigating. Local journalists interpreted the news as a hopeful sign that the authorities were beginning to hold criminal police officers accountable, but it was unclear if and how exactly the suspects had any links to the Neto and Carvalho murders.</p>
<p>On August 19, 2015, a court convicted Alessandro Neves Augusto, known as ""Pitote,"" for killing Carvalho and sentenced him to 14 years and three months, according to news reports. Augusto was <a href=""/2015/06/gunman-convicted-in-2013-murder-of-brazilian-journ.php"">sentenced</a> in June to 16 years in jail for Neto's murder. The two sentences would run consecutively, the prosecutor told CPJ. Augusto said he would appeal.</p>

<p>Abd Elaziz was a staff reporter for the local Dubai newspaper <i>XPRESS</i>, which is affiliated with the English-language daily <i>Gulf News</i>. However, in August 2013, Abdul Hamid Ahmad, editor-in-chief of <i>Gulf News</i>, told CPJ that Abd Elaziz was not on assignment for either outlet and had returned to Egypt on annual leave, he said. Her reporting for <i>Gulf News</i> included various topics, including <a href=""http://m.gulfnews.com/sport/bungee-jumping-thrill-in-dubai-1.1155091"">sports</a> and <a href=""http://gulfnews.com/xpress/don-t-arrest-me-i-m-hiv-positive-1.1062690"">sexually transmitted disease</a>s.</p>
<p>In September 2013, the month after her death, Ahmed Abd Elaziz, Habiba's father and a former media consultant to Morsi, said in a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cohseVXKTlI"">video</a> posted on a YouTube channel belonging to Al-Omah Electronic News<b> </b>that the journalist was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJVEon1qpxA"">shot</a> by a sniper while she was videotaping security forces shooting at Morsi supporters as the sit-in was dispersed.</p>
<p>Abd Elaziz's father said she was on assignment for Al-Jazeera Mubasher channel when she was killed.</p>
<p>Mahmoud Ahmed, a staff member of Al-Jazeera Mubasher, confirmed to CPJ in August 2015 that Al-Jazeera asked Abd Elaziz to cover the Raba'a sit-in for the network. He said she covered activities including daily protests, and that she and other journalists sent their footage to videographers at a media office on site.</p>
<p>Ahmed told CPJ that the network was warned that security forces would be raiding the sit-in and that some of their photographers had been arrested. He said Abd Elaziz stayed at the sit-in throughout and that she covered the dispersal as it began.</p>
<p>Ahmed told CPJ that Abd Elaziz's footage was later used in the documentary ""Raba'a's Fire,"" which covered the lives of protesters and the casualties of Egyptian security forces. The documentary, which was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgHpuRVM75o"">aired </a>by Al-Jazeera on the first anniversary of the Raba'a dispersal on August 14, 2014, lists Abd Elaziz as a videographer.</p>
<p>Egyptian security forces <a href=""/2013/07/al-jazeera-raided-3-others-shut-egypt.php"">raided</a> Al-Jazeera Mubasher's offices and arrested several staff members in July 2013, following the ouster of Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsi. State media and the transitional government accused the channel of being an outpost for the Brotherhood group, and the channel was <a href=""/2013/08/egypt-bans-al-jazeera-detains-journalists-raids-ou.php"">banned</a> in August 2013.</p>
<p>Qotb al-Arabi, the head of Doha-based Arab Monitor for Press Freedom, told CPJ that the Egyptian government's crackdown on opposition journalists and those affiliated with Al-Jazeera journalists caused many reporters to decline to be identified as working with the network for security reasons.</p>

Raouf, Beheira bureau chief for the state paper <i>Al-Ahram</i>, was killed when
Egyptian soldiers at a checkpoint opened fire on his vehicle as a nightly
military-imposed curfew was about to begin. The attack, which took place in the
Nile Delta city of Damanhur, also wounded Hamid al-Barbary, Beheira bureau
chief for the state newspaper <i>Al-Gomhuria</i>.</p>

<p>Al-Barbary
told CPJ that Abdel Raouf had offered to drive home several journalists after a
joint meeting with the new governor of Beheira. The two of them were the only
ones left in the car as they approached the checkpoint. Al-Barbary told CPJ
that soldiers gestured to them, telling them to leave the checkpoint, so Abdel
Raouf turned the car around. The soldiers then opened fire on the car,
al-Barbary said, and Abdel Raouf was hit in the head. The car swerved and hit a
light pole. </p>

<p>An
army spokesman issued a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Egy.Army.Spox/posts/358236370974018"">statement</a>
on the night of the attack, claiming the car had ""raised suspicion by driving
at high speed during curfew hours near a military checkpoint without reacting
to calls or to warning gunshots in the air."" The statement also said the
soldiers thought the car was trying to escape from the checkpoint.</p>

<p>Al-Barbary
disputed the statement, telling CPJ that ""there were no warning gunshots or
even any calls for us to stop"" after the car turned around. He said the
shooting occurred shortly after 6 p.m.--which was before the curfew and not after,
as the army had claimed. </p>

<p>The
curfew, which begins every night at 7 p.m., was imposed by authorities after
security forces dispersed two sit-ins supportive of ousted President Mohamed
Morsi on August 14, igniting a week of violence that left approximately 1,000
dead. Journalists are officially exempt from the curfew. </p>

<p>The Egyptian
Journalists Syndicate said it <a href=""http://www.youm7.com/News.asp?NewsID=1212089"">received</a> several
complaints by journalists saying they were harassed by soldiers at checkpoints
despite showing their ID cards. News
accounts have also <a href=""http://www.vetogate.com/536326#.Uhd4CdK-1I5"">reported</a>
cases of Egyptian soldiers <a href=""http://www.albawabhnews.com/News/119232"">opening
fire</a> on civilians at checkpoints<b> </b>during curfew hours. The attack on
the journalists' car took place on the same day that armed militants killed at
least 25 Egyptian soldiers in the Sinai city of Rafah, according to <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/19/world/meast/egypt-sinai-ambush"">news

<p>The
military said it has opened an investigation into the incident, <a href=""http://www.almasryalyoum.com/node/2054756"">reports</a> said. A day after
al-Barbary spoke to the press about the shooting, the army issued another
statement, accusing the journalist of opening fire on the checkpoint. The prosecutor
general subsequently ordered al-Barbary to be taken into custody. He was

point he left to upload the footage on the Internet. He was headed back to
resume filming when a shell exploded in front of him and he was hit by shrapnel,

after being hit. </p>

protests in Daraa. A friend of al-Musalama, who is a member of a local <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/DaraaCam"">media group</a> in Daraa, confirmed Abo Kasem's statements

The gunmen fled the scene. Dabholkar died from injuries sustained to his neck and back, police said.</p>
<p>Dabholkar was the editor of a weekly Marathi-language print magazine called <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/collections/2628308/SADHANA-Marathi-magazine""><i style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">Sadhana</i></a> (Spiritual Devotion), which promotes scientific thought and covers topics including caste, politics, and religion. Over the years, Dabholkar had angered many Indians with his lectures and writings, which propagated rationalism and scientific thinking in a country where superstitious beliefs are still rampant, the reports said.</p>
<p>Dabholkar, a prominent campaigner against religious superstition, had also spent several years writing in support of legislation to ban fraudulent and exploitative superstitious practices. A few days before his murder, the Maharashtra state government said it would introduce a controversial anti-superstition bill, according to <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-23756353"">reports</a>.</p>
<p>Dabholkar had received threats in the days before his murder, his son, Hamid, told NDTV. <i>Sadhana</i> often published articles on sensitive issues, including the creation of a separate Telangana state, student suicides, farmer suicides, slums, and the ideology behind India's Naxalite movement.</p>
<p>Dabholkar had also founded the Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (Committee for Eradication of Blind Faith), a group that encouraged social reform in India.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Also in August 2013, Pune police arrested two alleged arms dealers, Manish Nagori and Vilas Khandelwal, on charges of extortion, <a href=""http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/five-months-on-cops-make-first-arrests-in-dabholkar-murder-case/"">reports</a> said. The pair, who were later named as suspects in the journalist's murder, were released on bail because of a lack of evidence, police said, <a href=""http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/evidence-lacking-in-dabholkar-case-police/article5934711.ece"">according to reports</a>. Because the men face charges in other cases, they remain in jail. Both have denied any role in the murder, and Nagori said that investigating authorities offered him money to accept involvement in the murder, <a href=""http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-ats-offered-rs25-lakh-to-own-up-to-killing-narendra-dabholkar-accused-1954863"">reports</a> said. Authorities denied the allegation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In May 2014 the Maharashtra state government handed the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation. Investigations were delayed for a year because of staff shortages at the agency, <a href=""http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/dabholkar-case-cbi-staff-shortage-slows-down-probe/article7544581.ece"">according to reports</a>.

<p> </p>
<p>In July 2015, relatives of Dabholkar filed a writ petition at the Bombay High Court seeking court monitoring of the investigation, according to <a href=""http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/dabholkar-kin-move-hc-for-monitoring-cbi-probe/"">reports</a>. In December 2015, the Central Bureau of Investigation informed the Bombay High Court that it had identified two suspects and handed the names to the court, <a href=""http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/dabholkar-murder-case-2-suspects-identified-cbi-to-high-court/"">reports</a> said.

identified him as Alaa Edwar Butros. </p>

<p>Local
journalist Wsam Yousif Boho<b> </b>told CPJ that Butros had received anonymous
death threats in the days before his death in which he was told to stop reporting
or that he would be killed. It is not clear if the threats stemmed from any
specific work of Butros. </p>

<p>Butros
worked as a freelance cameraman for multiple local TV<b> </b>channels,
including <a href=""http://www.alrasheedmedia.com/"">Al-Rasheed</a> and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/%D9%82%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D9%86%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%8A%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%86%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%88%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%80%D8%BA%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9/107566879413717"">Nineveh
al-Ghad</a>, which covers local news and cultural events. He also worked as an
artistic photographer, focusing his work on nature, children, and daily life in
Mosul, Nineveh al-Ghad <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFv-VN5oQb0"">reported</a>
before his death.</p>

<p>Boho
said Butros often covered local news concerning the government, police, and
military. Militant groups often target Iraqi journalists who deal with official
sources, especially the security services, a tactic <a href=""/killed/2006/riyad-muhammad-ali.php"">used</a> at the height
of violence in the Iraq War. The Al-Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State in Iraq and
Sham, for example, has <a href=""/killed/2008/sirwa-abdel-wahab.php"">targeted</a>
journalists in Mosul whom it considers <a href=""/killed/2007/amer-malallah-al-rashidi.php"">collaborators</a>
with the U.S.-backed Iraqi government, according to CPJ research.</p>

<p>With
the resurgence of militant groups across the country, there has been a <a href=""/blog/2013/12/too-many-triggermen-too-little-justice-in-iraq.php"">spike</a>
in general violence in the country as well as a rash of journalist killings in Mosul.</p>

<p>According
to the Iraqi Journalistic Freedoms Observatory, Iraqi security forces recently
discovered a purported assassination list of 44 journalists during a raid on a
building in Mosul that housed militants. It is not clear if any of the most
recent killings were related to this list, but several journalists in Mosul say
anti-government militants are targeting journalists considered supportive of
the government.</p>

<p>News
reports also said Butros was Christian, which could have also played a role in
his murder. Christians across Iraq have been targeted by militant groups in
recent years, leading many to flee the country, according to <a href=""http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/culture/2013/08/iraq-christians-face-challenges-migration.html"">news

<p>On October 26, 2014, a criminal court sentenced Twana Khaleefa to death for the murder, according to news reports. Rahman Gharib, general coordinator for the Metro Center, told CPJ that Khaleefa originally confessed to the murder, saying he killed Garmyane because the journalist belonged to the Communist Party, which he blamed for the death of two family members. Despite the original confession, Khaleefa appealed the court's decision. No court date was set as of November 2014. Another defendant, who was not named in the news reports, was acquitted for lack of evidence.</p>
<p>In a November 2014 interview with Kurdish journalist Kamal Chomani, Garmyane's brother, Karwan Ahmed, said he believed Garmyane was killed for his coverage of corrupt politicians, Chomani told CPJ.

In their statement, the Maoists accused Reddy of being a police informer, but did not substantiate their claims.</p>

In March 2008, he was arrested and accused of being linked to the Maoists. He denied the allegations and was later released on bail.</p>
<p>Four months after the murder, the highest decision-making body of the Maoist party released a statement about the killing. In an April 2014 <a href=""http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maoists-say-journalist-killing-was-a-mistake/article5885519.ece"">press statement</a>, the body said there was a ""misunderstanding"" between members and the party leadership, which led to the killing. The statement by the party said that a decision was taken to kill Sai Reddy for his ""anti-people"" writing. When police arrested Reddy in 2008 on suspicion of being a Maoist, the party changed its perception of him. This was not conveyed to local members, who killed him, the statement said.

support groups suggested this was an intentional killing.</p>

<p>Dahar's sister and brother-in-law

""not for resale"" stamp on it, they said. The journalist was killed a few

had broadcast a story on drug sales. At the time he was killed, he was working
on a report about the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical drugs in the area,
according to Nasir Baig Chughtai, the director of news for Abb Takk. According
to Dahar's family, medications allocated by a local NGO for the poor were being
resold illegally. Chughtai told CPJ that Dahar had
covered a range of stories on sensitive local issues, including politics and
poverty, and had been killed in retaliation for his work.</p>

<p>Dahar's family as well as several<span style=""color:#282828""> local journalists expressed dismay at what they felt was

In October, IPID <a href=""http://www.ipid.gov.za/media_statements/23102014.asp"">recommended</a> to the Director of Public Prosecutions that two police officers should be prosecuted for shooting dead Tshele and two protesters that day.<b> </b>The Director of Public Prosecutions charged both officers with murder, attempted murder, one count of illegal possession of unlicensed ammunition and one count of pointing of a firearm.

<p>Armed men had intercepted Jiménez at his home in the town of Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, after the journalist had dropped his children off at school, news <a href=""http://www.animalpolitico.com/2014/02/alertan-sobre-desaparicion-de-periodista-gregorio-jimenez/#axzz2sMcpDX6F"">reports said</a>. Jiménez covered crime and security for the newspapers <i>Notisur</i> and <i>Liberal del Sur</i> and had reported on local abductions and violence toward migrants, according to local journalists. The journalist sometimes used the pseudonym ""The Panther"" for security reasons, according to <a href=""http://www.milenio.com/policia/Goyo-queria-periodista-peligroso-esposa-Gregorio-Jimenez-Cruz-asesinato-secuestrado_0_244776059.html"">news reports</a>.</p>
<p>Days after finding Jiménez's body, authorities said one of the bodies found buried with him belonged to an abducted union leader whose disappearance the journalist had covered, according to news reports.</p>
<p>Veracruz authorities <a href=""http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2014/02/11/943279"">announced</a> they had five suspects in custody and were searching for others. One of the detainees, José Luis Márquez Hernández, who went by the name ""El Pony,"" allegedly confessed to being the leader of the group that tortured and killed the journalist, according to <a href=""http://www.diariopresencia.com/nota.aspx?ID=68908&amp;List=%7BE99F52BD-B89D-4D80-A5BB-BCD1566AE98A%7D"">reports</a>. Authorities also identified one of the detainees as Teresa de Jesús Hernández Cruz, the owner of a local bar and a neighbor of Jiménez, who they said had ordered the crime for 20,000 pesos (US$1,500) because of a personal dispute, according to news reports.</p>
<p>The Veracruz state chief of staff, Erick Lagos, <span style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"">initially</span> <a href=""http://www.milenio.com/policia/Pago-vecina-pesos-matar-periodista-gregorio-veracruz-venganza_0_243576180.html"">told</a> the daily <i>Milenio</i> that the murder was a matter of personal revenge and had no link to Jiménez's journalism. Local journalists told CPJ that they were disturbed by how quickly local authorities had moved to rule out any journalism-related motive in the case. State spokeswoman Gina Domínguez then backtracked and <a href=""http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/estados/2014/venganza-reportero-vocera-986940.html"">told</a> reporters that authorities had not ruled out any motive and that they were investigating, but that they were principally looking into the theory of a personal dispute.</p>
<p>Sandra Segura, a journalist with the local daily <i>Notiver</i>, along with another journalist who asked to remain anonymous, cast doubt on the official version of the crime. Segura told CPJ that as part of his recent investigation into violence against migrants, Jiménez had written an article about the kidnapping of two migrants at a local bar. News reports conflicted as to whether the bar mentioned in the story was the same one owned by Hernández <span style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"">Cruz.</span></p>
<p>Cristina Hernández, the journalist's wife, <a href=""http://www.milenio.com/policia/gregorio-periodista-Veracruz-asesinaron-secuestraron-venganza_0_243576296.html"">told</a> <i>Milenio</i> that she believed the bar owner had ordered the murder in retaliation for an article Jiménez had published about a stabbing that occurred near her bar and because of a personal dispute between their daughters. The journalist's daughters later testified that the bar owner had threatened their father because of the article about the stabbing, according to <a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/m-xico-periodista-muerto-amenazado-por-trabajo-021913291.html"">news reports</a>.</p>
<p>The journalist's daughters said Hernández and her bar had <a href=""http://bigstory.ap.org/article/daughters-mexican-reporter-threatened-stories-0"">ties to the larger activities</a> of the feared organized crime <a href=""http://revistaera.com/index.php/k2-reportaje/item/4946-a-gregorio-lo-mataron-los-z"">group</a> Los Zetas, according to reports citing family statements. Segura also questioned the plausibility of Hernández having hired so many people to participate in the crime and the relatively small amount of money allegedly involved.</p>
<p>On February 13, several of the detainees, who were denied bail, said in a hearing that they had previously confessed to the crime under torture by law enforcement officials, according to <span style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;""><a href=""http://diario.mx/Nacional/2014-02-13_3df98bb8/presuntos-asesinos-de-periodista-de-veracruz-denuncian-tortura/"">news reports</a></span>.</p>
<p>Two days later, the state Attorney General Felipe Amadeo Flores Espinosa said that several international and local human rights and journalist groups, including CPJ, would be <a href=""http://sipse.com/mexico/disposicion-ong-expediente-periodista-gregorio-jimenez-76011.html"">granted access</a> to the files in the investigation, which he emphasized was ongoing and would include the journalist's work as a possible motive.</p>
<p>On the weekend of February 15, a group of journalists and representatives from local and international free press organizations, calling itself the ""Observation Mission,"" <a href=""https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-15164-mexican-journalists-call-national-protest-combat-violence-against-communicators#.UwQfli-fccU.twitter"">traveled</a> to Veracruz, spoke with local authorities, and <a href=""http://www.sdpnoticias.com/local/veracruz/2014/02/18/pide-mision-de-observacion-a-la-pgr-atraer-el-caso-del-periodista-gregorio-jimenez"">requested</a> that the federal special prosecutor for crimes against freedom of expression take jurisdiction for the case.</p>
<p>Days after the mission, in the face of sustained criticism, both Flores and Domínguez <a href=""http://www.sinembargo.mx/20-02-2014/909966"">resigned</a> from their positions, although officials denied it was related to Jiménez's murder. CPJ was told by the incoming Attorney General's office that it would still have access to the files on the murder.</p>
<p>Veracruz is one of the most dangerous states in Mexico for the press, according to CPJ research.

The assailants shot him at close range and fled the scene.</p>
<p>Horner, a Hong Kong-based journalist who held both British and Swedish citizenship, was a reporter for<b> </b>Sveriges Radio, Sweden's national public broadcaster. At the time of the shooting, he was interviewing local security guards and was looking for a survivor of the attack on the Lebanese restaurant, the report said.</p>
<p>Horner had worked with Sveriges Radio since 2001 and had traveled to Afghanistan in the past, including to document the fall of the Taliban in 2001. He had also covered the Iraq War in 2003 and the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, according to <a href=""http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h-G0-tY9mmu-AZ78CGK5LLtdNVcg?docId=324022c4-e907-4901-a09d-a8cbaa311e4c"">Agence France-Presse.</a></p>
<p>The day after his death, news accounts reported that a Taliban splinter group, Feday-e-Mahaz, claimed responsibility for Horner's death. Its leader, Haji Najibullah, was also responsible for the 2008 kidnapping of <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">New York Times'</i> journalist David Rohde, <a href=""http://www.thenation.com/article/156520/after-david-rohdes-escape-taliban-feud""><i style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">The Nation</i></a> reported. The group said in a statement that it had targeted Horner because he was a spy and not a journalist, <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2579272/Taliban-splinter-group-say-executed-British-Swedish-journalist-shot-head-Afghanistan-MI6-spy.html"">reports</a> said.</p>
<p>The Afghanistan Analysts Network, a research organization that works in Kabul and is funded by the Swedish and Norwegian governments, issued a <a href=""http://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/the-murder-of-swedish-journalist-nils-horner-an-assessment-of-the-fedai-mahaz-claim"">report</a> shortly after the killing that cast doubt on the claims put forward by Feday-e-Mahaz. AAN suggested the militant group was attempting to cash in on the publicity surrounding the high-profile attack on an international journalist in Kabul. AAN also suggested the possibility that Horner could have been killed as a result of any individual or local group wanting to ""kill a foreigner.""</p>
<p>Horner's death came less than a month before scheduled presidential elections to replace Hamid Karzai.

Kathy Gannon, AP special correspondent for the region, was wounded in the attack. The two were in a car with a translator and another AP freelance photographer.</p>
<p>Niedringhaus and Gannon were traveling in a convoy of election workers delivering ballots from the center of Khost city to the outskirts, in Tani district, according to the AP report which cited AP staff who were on the scene. The convoy was protected by Afghan security forces. After opening fire on the car, the officer surrendered to other police and was arrested.</p>
<p>The shooting happened the day before nationwide elections for a president and provincial councils, which the Taliban had vowed to disrupt, according to reports.</p>
<p>There was an uptick in attacks in Afghanistan in the weeks leading up to the election. About a month before Niedringhaus' death, British-Swedish journalist Nils Horner was shot dead in broad daylight in Kabul's diplomatic district, news reports said. In January, a Lebanese restaurant popular with foreigners was attacked in a suicide bombing.</p>
<p>On July 23, 2014, a court in Nangahar convicted Naqibullah, an Afghan police commander who goes by only one name, as many Afghans do, in the attack that killed Niedringhaus. He was <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/23/ap-photographer-death-sentence-afghan-police_n_5613783.html"" target=""_blank"">found guilty</a> of murder and treason.

The suspects fled the scene on a motorcycle. The journalist's family members rushed her to a nearby hospital, where she died, the reports said.</p>
<p>Garcia was a reporter for the tabloid newspaper <i>Remate </i>and host of a local blocktime radio talk show at dwAD radio station. She was a member of the National Press Club and had served as president of the Confederation of Active Media Practitioners Organization, a group of local journalists in the region, reports said. Radio hosts who lease airtime on local stations, called block-timers, are frequently targeted in provincial areas of the Philippines, according to CPJ data.</p>
<p>Justice Secretary Leila de Lima told CPJ in an interview on September 4 that the Department of Justice considered Garcia's murder to be work-related and had deployed a special investigation team comprised of multiple agencies to pursue the case. De Lima said in the same interview that a senior police officer was the main suspect in the killing.</p>
<p>Garcia had a reputation among the local press for being a hard-hitting journalist who exposed wrongdoing in the Cavite police force, <a href=""http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/04/07/1309717/tabloid-reporter-shot-dead-cavite"" target=""_blank"">reports</a> said.</p>
<p>News reports said that while Garcia was still conscious, she told her son Tristan that Tanza town police Superintendant Conrado Villaneuva was behind the attack. <i>Remate</i>'s publisher, Benny Antiporda, told local journalists that she and the police official had had a heated verbal altercation a few days before her death at a local police station. Villaneuva denied the murder allegation, according to <a href=""http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/592586/dying-reporter-tags-tanza-town-cop-chief"">local reports</a>.</p>
<p>Villaneuva was suspended immediately following Garcia's murder in an effort to ensure he did not influence the investigation, according to news reports.</p>

<p>Ibrahim had <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmWRH2qvtlI"">reported</a> widely on the presence of Islamist militants in Raqqa in the months before he was kidnapped. His reports included coverage of Islamist militant groups who he said had imposed taxes on Christians and who he said had prevented aid from being delivered to the city.</p>
<p>As part of his work for Shaam News Network, Ibrahim also appeared on the opposition-based TV channels <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5ubR2BvXyk"">Syria al-Hur</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu0fxS-U-pk"">Syria al-Ghad</a>. He also worked for an online campaign called ""<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Raqqa.Sl2"">Raqqa is being slaughtered silently</a>,"" which posts news and photos of events in Raqqa and has criticized the harsh rule imposed by the Islamic State.</p>
<p>Abu Ibrahim Ar-Raqqawi, a Raqqa citizen who runs the campaign, told the <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/video/life-inside-the-isis-home-base-of-raqqa-syria/AA8CB9E3-B6A9-49AB-A2C9-F8E843413B85.html""><i>Wall Street Journal</i></a> that Ibrahim was killed because Islamic State militants caught him with material belonging to the campaign.</p>
<p>Ar-Raqqawi told CPJ that he and Ibrahim would meet in secret repeatedly to share news and information for the campaign because Islamic State had placed media restrictions on journalists covering Raqqa.</p>

Hamad was accompanying an ambulance in Shijaiyah when the vehicle was hit by a shell fired by Israeli forces, Alool said. A second shell hit, killing the journalist and Fouad Jaber, a Palestinian medic, Alool said.</p>
<p>At the time of the shelling, Alool was at an ambulance station when he heard over the radio that Hamad had been hit. Alool said he waited at a local hospital for four hours until he received confirmation that Hamad had been killed. News reports said that the <a href=""http://www.afp.com/ar/news/2643638/"" target=""_blank"">violence</a> in Shijaiyah was so intense and the number of casualties so high that ambulances were unable to transport the wounded.</p>

<p>The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to CPJ's<b> </b>request<b> </b>for comment on Hamad's death. But IDF spokesman Lt. Col Peter Lerner said at a July 22 press conference in response to CPJ's question about the recent death and injury of journalists and media workers in Gaza that ""we do not target journalists [...] but journalists do sometimes put themselves in risky positions."" He continued, ""We have to do our best to facilitate and keep them out of harm's way."" The IDF's Chief of General Staff Benny Gantz, speaking to media on July 20 about the operation in Shijaiyah, <a href=""http://hamodia.com/2014/07/21/chief-general-staff-summarizes-operation-thus-far"">said</a> he regrets civilian casualties and that Israel takes measures to uphold its ""moral obligation""  to prevent them.

On August 19, the group posted a video claiming to show the beheading of U.S. freelance journalist <a href=""/killed/2014/james-foley.php"">James Foley</a> and threatening to do the same to Sotloff. Islamic State <a href=""http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_MISSING_AMERICAN_SYRIA_PARENTS?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT"">claimed to have executed</a> the journalists in retribution for U.S. military intervention in Iraq. In August, the U.S. had launched air strikes in Iraq in an attempt to prevent militants from taking control of key areas, news reports said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sotloff, who wrote for outlets including <i><a href=""http://world.time.com/contributor/steven-sotloff/"">Time </a></i>and <i><a href=""http://t.co/rXCM4DMc"">Foreign Policy</a></i>, was abducted along with his Syrian fixer and driver in August 2013 shortly after crossing the Turkish-Syrian border, according to a Syrian familiar with the abduction who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution. The Syrians were released in the following days, but Sotloff remained captive for more than a year, along with several other international journalists held hostage by Islamic State.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the request of the family, CPJ did not publicize the case until the release of the video purporting to show Foley's murder. In a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS1QNv8L0sM"">video</a> released on August 27, 2014, Sotloff's mother, Shirley Sotloff, pleaded with the leader of Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, to show mercy and release her son.</p>

<p>Dmitry Steshin and Aleksandr Kots, journalists for the pro-Kremlin newspaper <em>Komsomolskaya Pravda</em>, went in search of Stenin and on August 22 published an article on their findings. The article, which was later removed from <em>K</em><em>omsomolskaya Pravda</em>&rsquo;swebsite but was <a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3Awww.kp.ru%2Fdaily%2F26272%2F3149380%2F&amp;oq=cache%3Awww.kp.ru%2Fdaily%2F26272%2F3149380%2F&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.1126j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8"">available in Google cache</a>, said the two journalists found a car, similar to the one in which Stenin was last seen, that had been burned and had three charred bodies inside with professional photo equipment in the trunk. The two reported that the car was found in a field near the town of Snizhne. </p>
<p>On September 3, Russian authorities and news outlets <a href=""http://www.gazeta.ru/social/2014/09/03/6201301.shtml"">reported</a> that Stenin had been killed in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine the day after he went missing. </p>
<p>In a <a href=""http://sledcom.ru/actual/415391/"">statement</a> released the same day, Russia&rsquo;s Investigative Committee said Stenin was killed on August 6 during what they said was a Ukrainian army attack on a column of cars carrying refugees from the east and guarded by a group of pro-Russia separatists. The authorities did not support their allegations with any evidence, and did not say how they determined the source of fire or the date of Stenin&rsquo;s death. The statement said DNA tests had confirmed that the body inside the car was Stenin&rsquo;s. Investigators for the committee said separatists gave the photojournalist&rsquo;s remains to Russian authorities on August 27. </p>
<p>The other two victims were not immediately identified.</p>
<p>The Investigative Committee and <a href=""http://ria.ru/society/20140903/1022519015.html#ixzz3CED7X2ug"">Rossiya Segodnya accused</a> Ukrainian paratroopers with the 79th airborne brigade of killing Stenin during the alleged attack in August. Aleksandr Danilyuk, from the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, denied the accusations, and <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/russian/rolling_news/2014/09/140903_rn_ukraine_stenin_reaction.shtml"">told the BBC&rsquo;s Russian service</a> he had seen no evidence that proved Stenin was killed by Ukrainian soldiers. </p>
<p>Following the journalist&rsquo;s disappearance, an official with Ukraine&rsquo;s Interior Ministry, Anton Gerashchenko, <a href=""/2014/08/ukraine-must-clarify-status-of-russian-journalist.php"">suggested</a> in an interview with the Latvian radio station Baltkom<strong> </strong>that Stenin might have been detained in the conflict area by Ukraine&rsquo;s security services. Gerashchenko later retracted his statement, telling Rossiya Segodnya<strong> </strong>that his words had been taken out of context.</p>
In a statement, reported by Rossiya Segodnya, Gerashchenko said on September 3 that Ukrainian authorities did not have access to the separatist-controlled region where Stenin was believed to have been killed, and so were unable to conduct an investigation. &ldquo;We cannot conduct a probe without access to the body,&rdquo; <a href=""http://ria.ru/incidents/20140903/1022562795.html#ixzz3CHRrtKg9"">Gerashchenko said</a>.",,,,,2014,UP,UA,.ua,Ukraine,ukraine,Europe,europe,europe,Ukraine,Confirmed

<p></p>
<p>An army statement addressed to the local Interim Press Council on October 23 said Naing was first apprehended on September 30 and killed on October 4, according to news reports. His body was buried by authorities at Shwe War Chong, a village outside of Kyaikmayaw, without notifying his family, the reports said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Naing had been reporting from an area held by the rebel Democratic Karen Benevolent Army before he was arrested. Naing, also known as Par Gyi, contributed news and photos to the publications <i>Eleven Media</i>, <i>Yangon Times</i>, and <i>The Voice</i>, according to local journalists and news reports.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The army statement said Naing was shot when he attempted to seize a soldier's gun and escape detention, news reports <a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/myanmar-army-kills-journalist-calls-karen-rebel-082339303.html"" target=""_blank"">said</a>. The statement also said Naing served as a ""communications captain"" for the Klohtoobaw Karen Organization, the political wing of the DKBA, according to news reports. The organization denied that Naing was affiliated with them, <i>The Irrawaddy</i>, an exile-run media outlet, <a href=""http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/missing-reporter-killed-custody-burma-army-report.html"" target=""_blank"">reported</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Earlier news reports citing Naing's wife, Than Dar, said the journalist had been held at the Light Infantry Division 208's base in Kyaikmayaw. Than Dar said in a press conference days before the army released its statement on Naing's killing that police told her Naing had been beaten while held at the base, according to reports.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Than Dar filed murder charges against the military for the death of her husband, according to news reports. Naing's body was exhumed on November 5 as part of a government investigation into his death, the <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-29910773"">BBC reported.</a> The Democratic Voice of Burma <a href=""http://www.dvb.no/news/par-gyi-tortured-before-death-myanmar-burma/45665"">reported</a>, citing an eyewitness, that Naing had been shot five times and showed signs of torture including a broken jaw, a caved-in skull, and swelling on the torso indicating broken ribs.</p>
<p>In November 2014, a military court in a secret trial acquitted two soldiers of his death. Police pursuing a separate civil complaint announced they had stopped their investigation into the case in April 2016 after the Kyaikmayaw Township Court ruled the reporter had died of ""unnatural causes,"" press <a href=""http://www.mizzima.com/news-domestic/myanmar-shelves-investigation-journalist-killing"" target=""_blank"">reports</a> said. The ruling said that the court did not have jurisdiction over crimes committed by the military, the reports said.

<p>Simon, the committee's spokesman who uses a pseudonym to protect his family still in Syria, told CPJ that Mtawe'e was shot in the head by a sniper while he was on the fourth floor of a building, at least 700 meters away from fighting. He said that at the time of his death, Mtawe'e was reporting for the committee about the government's military forces advancing to regain control of the town of Zebdine in the outskirts of Damascus.</p>
<p>Mtawe'e was one of three members of the Zebdine Coordination Committee, where he worked as a field reporter and covered clashes in Zebdine and surrounding towns, Simon told CPJ. The Zebdine Coordination Committee is an opposition media group that is part of the umbrella Local Coordination Committees of Syria. According to the group's spokesman, the committee was founded early in the Syrian war as a branch of the Local Coordination Committees that focused on Zebdine and nearby areas. The group's members participate in opposition activities, including organizing protests and delivering humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>Mtawe'e reported on clashes, including their aftermath and any casualties, as well as on humanitarian issues. The committee issues its coverage on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Zebdine.Coordination3/timeline"">Facebook </a>where it has almost 3,000 followers. Other local news outlets such as <a href=""http://orient-news.net/?page=news_show&amp;id=82866"">Orient News</a> and <a href=""http://www.dp-news.com/mobile/detail.aspx?articleid=170430"">Day Press News</a> have used the Coordination Committee's pictures in their coverage of the area.</p>
<p>The committee spokesman told CPJ that Mtawe'e gave up his job as an electrician when the Syrian civil war began and started documenting events with his camera in and around his town. He later became an official member of the Zebdine Coordination Committee. Mtawe'e also posted pictures and videos of the clashes on his personal <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/zaher.sy.50"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyFmDL2tFCEwJESJ6XneyLA"">YouTube</a> pages. His videos, which were often posted with the Zebdine Coordination Committee's logo, have more than 100,000 views.</p>
<p>Mtawe'e's brother told CPJ that the journalist would often report from the frontlines and that local news outlets would often ask Mtawe'e for his photographs, videos, and any other information on the conflict in the area.</p>
<p>His brother told CPJ that there had been previous attempts by government forces to kill Mtawe'e, and he also faced several threats from Islamist groups after exposing corruption in their leadership. CPJ could not confirm these claims.</p>
<p>The day Mtatwe'e died, the Zebdine Coordination Committee posted a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Zebdine.Coordination3/photos/a.330790513725347.1073741828.330788810392184/472552552882475/?type=1&amp;theater"">photo</a> of him on its Facebook page that showed him holding a gun with a caption calling him a ""mujahid"" hero and journalist.

Colleagues and media monitors with whom CPJ spoke during an investigative trip to the Iraqi city of Irbil in October 2015 said al-Hadidi was later killed, although the date of his death remains unclear.</p>
<p>Reports of his death began to emerge two weeks after he was taken. Ahmad al-Rubaei, from the Iraqi monitoring group Journalistic Freedoms Observatory, told CPJ al-Hadidi was killed on July 15, 2014. However, the Nineveh Media Foundation, a small Iraqi monitoring group, said that al-Hadidi's family were not summoned to identify his body until March 2015. As of October 2015, the Nineveh Media Foundation counted al-Hadidi among the seven journalists it says were killed by Islamic State since its takeover of Mosul. The monitoring group's criteria is based on whether Islamic State returned the victim's body to the family.</p>
<p>Al-Hadidi's name appeared on a list of 2,070 Mosul residents Islamic State claims to have killed, which was posted in police stations and at coroner's offices in Mosul in September 2015. CPJ has not been able to independently verify that al-Hadidi's name appeared on the list.</p>
<p>A close friend of al-Hadidi, who asked not to be identified out of security concerns, told CPJ in an interview in the Iraqi city of Irbil, that the print journalist had criticized Islamic State ideology in his writing, and was producing a pamphlet on the militant group's crimes. He also ran as a candidate in two elections, including for former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's State of Law coalition, the friend said. CPJ was unable to determine what years he ran for election.</p>
<p>Although his political associations may have made him a target, al-Hadidi's journalism was a ""challenge to Islamic State's message,"" a senior editor at a Mosul newspaper who knew al-Hadidi and who asked not to be named for security reasons, told CPJ.</p>",,,,,2015,IZ,IQ,.iq,Iraq,iraq,Middle East,mideast,mideast,Iraq,Confirmed

Japanese authorities said the footage <a href=""http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2015/01/japanese-hostage-beheaded-isil-150131201857344.html"">appeared to be</a> authentic, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe vowed to ""make the terrorists pay,"" according to <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/02/world/departing-from-countrys-pacifism-japanese-premier-vows-revenge-for-killings.html"">reports.</a></p>
<p>A member of the militant group, who according to some news reports is the same man who murdered American freelancers <a href=""/killed/2014/james-foley.php"">James Foley</a> and <a href=""/killed/2014/steven-sotloff.php"">Steven Sotloff</a> in 2014, claimed in the video that Goto, also known as Kenji Jogo, was killed in retribution for Japan's participation in a coalition set up to stop Islamic State, according to <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2935025/Family-Jordanian-pilot-demand-know-alive-Isis-release-video-Jihadi-John-apparently-beheading-Japanese-hostage.html"">news reports</a>. Japan was not involved in airstrikes carried out in Iraq and Syria since August, but it had offered humanitarian aid to countries fighting Islamic State.<b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Islamic State had previously released four messages about Goto. In a video released on January 20, the group threatened to kill Goto and another Japanese hostage, Haruna Yukawa, unless it received a US$200 million ransom--the same sum the Japanese government had <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30893735"" target=""_blank"">pledged</a> in humanitarian assistance, according to <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/islamic-state-threatens-to-kill-japanese-hostages-1421737409?mod=WSJ_hppMIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsSecond"" target=""_blank"">news reports</a>. On January 24, the group released a video, with an audio message purportedly narrated by Goto, saying that Yukawa had been killed and changing the ransom demand to the release of <a href=""/2015/01/jordan-arrests-two-journalists-on-aiding-terrorism.php"">Sajida al-Rishawi</a>, a would-be Iraqi suicide bomber imprisoned in Jordan. On January 27, Islamic State released a third message, again purportedly narrated by Goto, warning that if al-Rishawi was not released within 24 hours, Goto and Muath al-Kaseasbeh, a Jordanian pilot also held captive by the group, would be killed. The following day the group distributed a final warning that if al-Rishawi was not brought to the Syrian-Turkish border by sunset on January 29, al-Kaseasbeh, would be killed immediately.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In response to the threats, Jordanian officials said they would be willing to release al-Rishawi in exchange for al-Kaseasbeh and Goto, according to news reports. In a video released on February 3, Islamic State militants killed al-Kaseasbeh by locking him in a cage and setting him alight. After the video's release Jordanian officials said, without citing evidence, that al-Kaseasbeh had been killed on January 3, weeks before the public negotiations began, according to <a href=""http://jordantimes.com/jordan-confirms-death-of-pilot-says-killed-january-3"">news reports</a>. If true, the claim brings into doubt whether a deal to release Goto and al-Kaseasbeh had been on the table. None of the publicly released messages from Islamic State explicitly offered the pilot's release.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 1996, Goto <a href=""http://ipgoto.com/about/%E5%BE%8C%E8%97%A4-%E5%81%A5%E4%BA%8C"" target=""_blank"">founded</a> Independent Press, a news website covering conflict, refugee populations, and poverty. Major Japanese outlets, including NHK World and Tokyo Broadcasting System, featured its reports. The 47-year-old journalist had covered the Syrian conflict with a focus on its humanitarian impact since the start of the civil war.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He disappeared in Syria on October 25 and on December 2 his wife, Rinko, received a message from Goto's captors confirming his kidnapping, his wife explained in a <a href=""https://rorypecktrust.org/rpt-live/January-2015/Urgent-plea-from-wife-of-Kenji-Goto"">statement</a> given to the freelancer support charity Rory Peck Trust on January 29. Rinko said in the statement that Goto ""went to Syria to show the plight of those who suffer,"" adding that she believes he ""may have also been trying to find out about Haruna Yukawa's situation.""</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUsL0Z3UymQ"">video</a> filmed in Aleppo and posted on YouTube on October 25, Goto said he planned to travel to Raqqa, the Islamic State stronghold, to ""get the story of what ISIS [Islamic State] wants to do in Syria."" He said he understood he was entering dangerous territory and that he would take responsibility if anything happened to him. According to Japanese <a href=""http://www.asahi.com/articles/ASH1N5V60H1NUTIL03H.html"">media reports</a>, Goto had told friends he would be back in Japan on October 29 to speak at an event.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Several news reports, including one that cited Goto's fixer in Syria who <a href=""http://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/english/news/20150121_25.html"">filmed</a> the Aleppo video, said Goto went to Raqqa <a href=""http://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/english/news/20150121_21.html"">in search of</a> Yukawa, who was abducted in August. According to <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/21/us-mideastcrisis-islamicstate-japan-idUSKBN0KU1XV20150121"">Reuters</a>, Yukawa and Goto first met in Syria in April 2014 and traveled to Iraq together in June. In August, Goto told Reuters that Yukawa needed someone with experience to help him survive combat zones.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the request of the family, the Committee to Protect Journalists did not publicize Goto's case until the release of the January 20 video.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As with Foley and Sotloff, it is not clear where and when Islamic State murdered Goto.</p>

The journalist and owner of the newspaper <i>La Unión</i> had been missing since January 2. On February 5, federal investigators said their DNA<b> </b>tests had confirmed the body was that of Sánchez, according to news reports.</p>
<p>Sánchez was <a href=""/2015/01/journalist-kidnapped-from-his-home-in-mexico.php"">kidnapped</a> from his home in the municipality of Medellín de Bravo on January 2 and his computer, camera, and other electronic materials seized, according to <a href=""http://www.animalpolitico.com/2015/01/reportan-secuestro-de-periodista-en-veracruz/"" target=""_blank"">news reports</a>. The journalist had founded <i>La Unión</i>, a small weekly print and online newspaper that often criticized city authorities, particularly the mayor, Omar Cruz Reyes, and denounced local criminal activity as well as the poor quality of basic services like garbage pickup and the absence of street lights.</p>
<p>A local journalist who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal told CPJ that Sánchez had not published a print edition in months due to financial constraints. The last story published on <i>La Unión</i>'s <a href=""http://launionver.blogspot.com/"" target=""_blank"">website</a> dated to April 2014, according to CPJ research. In the months before his death, according to local journalists and <a href=""http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/amenazo-alcalde-a-periodista-desaparecido-1420324872"" target=""_blank"">news reports</a>, Sánchez had posted on Facebook critical commentary about crime and the actions of the local government, links to articles, and videos. He also acted as a source for other Veracruz journalists, whom he often provided with photographs and other information.</p>
<p>In the days before Sánchez was kidnapped, the journalist <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/moisessanchezcerezo"" target=""_blank"">posted</a> on Facebook several photographs of protests against the governor, Javier Duarte de Ochoa, as well as links to articles about a recent murder. On December 13 and 14, he posted several articles, press releases, and a video regarding the formation of a neighborhood watch self-defense group in response to local crime. It wasn't clear whether Sánchez, who was also active in the group, was the author of any of the materials posted on Facebook.</p>
<p>The journalist who asked to remain anonymous told CPJ that information about self-defense groups was particularly sensitive for local officials who sought to downplay shortcomings in local law enforcement. The journalist's son, Jorge Sánchez, told CPJ that his father had been threatened by the mayor in connection with his coverage of the groups.</p>
<p>The state attorney general told reporters after the crime that he had evidence pointing toward the mayor. ""I have elements to suggest the mayor's participation,"" Veracruz state attorney general Luis Ángel Bravo said.</p>
<p>The state attorney general's office said a former Veracruz police officer turned drug trafficker, Noé Rodríguez, confessed to carrying out the abduction and murder, along with five other suspects, and said he had killed Sánchez the day of the kidnapping. The suspects were allegedly told by the deputy police chief of Medellín, Martín López Meneses, to kidnap and kill Sánchez, according to the state attorney general's office's statement which cited Rodríguez. López, who was also the driver and bodyguard of Mayor Cruz, was <a href=""http://www.animalpolitico.com/2015/01/moises-sanchez-lo-que-se-sabe-y-las-dudas-de-la-investigacion-del-periodista-asesinado-en-veracruz/"" target=""_blank"">placed</a> under preventive detention shortly after the murder.</p>
<p>Rodríguez also<b> </b>alleged that López had received his orders from Mayor Cruz, who wanted the journalist to be ""disappeared"" because he was angered by Sánchez' coverage of local crime, according to <a href=""http://www.milenio.com/policia/Imputan_a_alcalde_muerte_de_periodista_veracruzano-alcalde_planea_muerte_periodista_0_452954706.html"" target=""_blank"">news reports</a>. In exchange, the reports said, Cruz would allow the criminal gang to deal drugs in the area. Cruz has denied involvement in the crime and maintained that he had no disagreements with Sánchez, according to <a href=""http://www.milenio.com/estados/alcalde_de_Medellin-desaparicion_periodistas_Veracruz-Omar_Cruz_alcalde_0_444555689.html"" target=""_blank"">news reports</a>.</p>
<p>In March 2015, the Veracruz state legislature voted to <a href=""http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2015/03/27/el-congreso-de-veracruz-desafora-al-alcalde-de-medellin-de-bravo"">strip</a> Cruz of the immunity from prosecution granted to him as an elected official. Cruz faces charges related to the murder, but has not yet <a href=""http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=420020"">been arrested</a> according to reports.</p>
<p>In November 2015, López was <a href=""https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-16438-article-19-release-suspect-moises-sanchez-cerezos-murder-opens-door-impunity"">released</a> from prison after a federal judge accepted his appeal on the grounds that there was not enough evidence to keep him in jail, according to press reports and a <a href=""http://www.veracruz.gob.mx/blog/2015/11/04/252259/"">press release</a> from <span>Luis Ángel Bravo Contreras, the</span> attorney general of Veracruz. The charges against him were not dropped, reports said.</p>
<p>In the days after the kidnapping, Governor Duarte <a href=""http://www.milenio.com/policia/periodistas_Veracruz-Moises_Sanchez_Cerezo-PGJE_Veracruz-asesinato_periodistas_Mexico_0_439156177.html"" target=""_blank"">referred</a> to Sánchez as an ""activist and taxi driver,"" which drew complaints from local journalists that the governor was trying to minimize Sánchez's work as journalist.</p>
<p>Veracruz is one of the most dangerous states in Mexico for the press. In the past, Governor Duarte's government has sought to <a href=""/killed/2014/gregorio-jimenez-de-la-cruz.php"">dismiss</a> any possible link between journalists' murders and their profession.</p>

<p>The attack occurred in a highly tense and politically volatile climate in a country confronted with the departure of hundreds of French citizens to fight with Islamic militants in Syria and Iraq; controversies around the place of Islam in French society; and the rise of the nationalist political party National Front, which topped the May 2014 elections to the European Parliament.</p>

<p>Islamic State militants had <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32147888"">advanced</a> from the nearby neighborhood of Hajar Aswad in the suburbs of Damascus and pushed into Yarmouk camp on April 1, 2015, the reports said. Khalifeh was reporting on the clashes between the militants and local groups, led by the Palestinian Aknaf Beit al-Maqdis militia, a Yarmouk-based rebel group comprised largely of local fighters, when he was struck, the <a href=""http://annaharkw.com/annahar/Article.aspx?id=543363"">reports</a> said.</p>

<p>Khalifeh also helped produce a <a href=""https://youtu.be/gr69XEBUdWU"">film</a> about daily life in the camp, which was published on YouTube by the not-for-profit Syrian media company <a href=""http://www.bidayyat.org/"">Bidayyat</a> two days after his death.</p>
<p>Fakhredeen told CPJ that he and Khalifeh had spoken in the week before his death. The editor said that although Khalifeh had not been specifically commissioned that day, the organization would have been published the footage of Islamic State's assault on Yarmouk.</p>
<p>According to Abdullah al-Khatib, a media activist who was also the journalist's friend, colleague, and roommate, Khalifeh had gone to cover the heavy shelling that day. Khalifeh lived with five other media activists, Khatib said.</p>
<p>In the following days, Khatib and others wrote about Khalifeh on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/jamal.htf?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts&amp;__mref=message"">Facebook</a>.

<p>Najjar joined TV channel Aleppo Today in early 2015.

Ruto is <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-24151392"">charged</a> with crimes against humanity for allegedly organizing part of the deadly violence that followed the December 2007 elections, in which more than 1,000 people <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/06/world/africa/06kenya.html?_r=0"">died</a> and hundreds of thousands were displaced.</p>

<p>Asked for comment, a spokesman for Ruto, David Mugonyi, dismissed claims of a connection between Kituyi's death and his reporting on the ICC case. ""I doubt the journalists' ability to investigate [Kituyi's] death. This is the province of the police and the journalists cannot purport to claim they know the reason or motive,"" he told CPJ.

The militants said the pretext for his murder was ""treason,"" the colleagues said.</p>
<p>Al-Baher, also known as Firas Yasin al-Jabouri, worked for five years as a video producer and technician for Al-Mosuliya TV, a local channel established by the U.S. in 2007 that was forced to close when Islamic State seized Mosul in June 2014. In early 2014, al-Baher joined the <a href=""http://naynawaalghad.tv/"">Nineveh al-Ghad</a> station as a coordinator of news output and a technician, an employee at the station, who asked not to be named due to security concerns, told CPJ. Nineveh al-Ghad was established by former Mosul governor Atheel Nujaifi, who also funds the channel. Both channels have been critical of Islamic State in their reporting.</p>
<p>On April 17, 2015, al-Baher's home was raided by Islamic State fighters, another former al-Mosuliya TV employee, who has not been named to protect his identity, said. The men looked through the contacts on al-Baher's computer and phone and found the numbers of police chiefs and other security officials, which the militants said showed he was collaborating with the previous government, the colleague said. Al-Baher was brought to an unofficial court Islamic State had set up in the headquarters of the anti-terrorism police in Mosul, where he was accused of treason. He was murdered on the banks of the Tigris, the colleague said.</p>
<p>A friend of al-Baher who was also employed at Nineveh al-Ghad, told CPJ how after hearing rumours in May 2015 that al-Baher had been killed, he spoke to the journalist's parents. They told him that on May 17, 2015 the family received a call to go to the coroner's office and identify the body of their son which, when they got there, appeared to have been shot several times. Al-Baher was killed at some point during his month-long incarceration, but CPJ was unable to determine the precise date.</p>

<p>Saldaña, 52, worked for the radio station La Ke Buena 100.9 FM in the town of Tierra Blanca, in Veracruz state. Octavio Bravo Bravo, Saldaña's colleague at the station, told CPJ that he last saw the journalist on May 2 in Veracruz.

<p>Organized crime, Bravo Bravo said, is rife in the Tierra Blanca region and is a topic on which journalists tend to stay silent, offering only basic details and not naming names. Saldaña pushed the envelope further than most, Bravo Bravo said. ""Among ourselves, we self-censor. You put your life at risk and that of your family, too,"" he said. ""I knew him as an earnest person: hard working, serious, responsible, very professional and competent. I don't know what happened.""</p>
<p>Oaxaca officials said they were investigating the murder, according to news reports. On May 22, authorities announced they had captured suspect Juan Carlos de la Cruz Vergara. The suspect was formally charged on May 27 of participating in the murder, but authorities didn't offer any further details or a possible motive, according to <a href=""http://e-veracruz.mx/nota/2015-05-27/periodismo/acusado-de-homicidio-de-armando-saldana-es-vinculado-proceso"">news reports</a>.

The officer also read out details of the case in a YouTube <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=10&amp;v=rZfw9h2w0yg"" target=""_blank"">video</a>.</p>
<p>Metzker, 67, wrote a blog called <a href=""http://corujaodenoticias.blogspot.com/"" target=""_blank""><i>Coruja Do Vale</i></a>, which focused on general political news and official wrongdoing in the impoverished north and eastern parts of Minas Gerais, one of Brazil's biggest states. The blog reported news such as arrests made at police roadblocks, parking violations by local authorities, and community interest stories, according to CPJ's review of its content.</p>
<p>The journalist's wife, Ilma Chaves Silva Borges, told CPJ that they lived in the town of Medina, but that Metzker had traveled to Padre Paraíso about three months ago to do some investigative work, about which she did not provide further details. ""He was doing investigative journalism in a region that is very dangerous,"" Borges told CPJ. ""There are lots of murders here. I think that the motive--given the barbarity of his murder--was because he hit on something. He investigated mayors, politicians, cargo robberies, prostitution,"" she said.</p>
<p>The magazine <a href=""http://epoca.globo.com/vida/noticia/2015/05/morte-selvagem-do-jornalista-evany-jose-metzker.html""><i>Época</i></a><i> </i>said that on his blog Metzker had published stories about government cars being used for personal use and poor local medical care, but that he was investigating even riskier stories about the activities of local criminal groups and drug traffickers. Several local <a href=""http://www.em.com.br/app/noticia/gerais/2015/05/18/interna_gerais,648879/corpo-de-jornalista-e-encontrado-decapitado-em-padre-paraiso.shtml"" target=""_blank"">news reports</a> said Metzker had been investigating a child prostitution ring that was active in the area. A May 9 post on his blog featured an image of a Wild West-style gunslinger with the words, ""Welcome to Padre Paraíso."" The caption below reads: ""Here there are no rules or laws.""</p>
<p>Fabrícia Noronha, the lead investigator in the case, told CPJ that authorities were pursuing two lines of investigation. ""One is that it was related to his work as an investigative journalist, and the other is a possible crime of passion,"" she said. She did not provide further details.</p>
<p>In the weeks after the crime, the local daily <a href=""http://www.otempo.com.br/cidades/morte-de-jornalista-n%C3%A3o-teria-liga%C3%A7%C3%A3o-com-suas-reportagens-1.1055468""><i>O Tempo</i></a> cited the police chief in charge of investigating the crime, Emerson Morais, as saying that he thought the line of investigation related to Metzker's journalism was ""weak."" The daily also cited<b> </b>anonymous officials who alleged Metzker could have been personally involved the child prostitution ring he was investigating, but provided no evidence or further details to back up the claim. A local journalist who spoke with CPJ but asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal said he had never heard anything linking Metzker personally to such activity before his death.</p>
<p>Metkzer's wife told local reporters she<b> </b>was <a href=""http://www.diariodepernambuco.com.br/app/noticia/brasil/2015/05/20/interna_brasil,577284/policia-ainda-nao-tem-pistas-sobre-assassinato-de-jornalista-no-vale-do-jequitinhonha.shtml"">certain</a> her husband had been killed for his work. In the days after the discovery of Metzker's body, two other journalists who asked to remain anonymous told the Minais Gerais Journalists Union that the climate for journalism was dangerous and that Metzker was fearless, according to <a href=""http://www.em.com.br/app/noticia/gerais/2015/05/20/interna_gerais,649694/dois-outros-jornalistas-do-vale-do-jequitinhonha-afirmam-ter-recebido.shtml"">news reports</a>.

<p>Singh also told Thakur that his foot was broken during an earlier attack on April 28 near his house, by people he alleged were ""the minister's henchmen.""</p>
<p>Singh's son, Raghvendra, filed a police complaint that named Verma and Rai, according to the Press Trust of India.

According to the report, police in May 2015 registered a case of attempted murder and kidnapping against Singh after a complaint by Amit Bhadauria, also a journalist.</p>
<p>Singh wrote on local politics and current affairs in Hindi-language newspapers and on his two <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/jagendr"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/spnnewsb"" target=""_blank"">pages</a>, which have more than 4,000 followers combined.

In a May 31 Hindi-language <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/jagendr"" target=""_blank"">Facebook post</a> with an accompanying photo of Verma, the journalist alleged that the minister was involved in the gang rape of a local woman, claims that were also <a href=""http://www.jagran.com/news/national-allegations-of-rape-on-state-minister-rammurti-singh-verma-12419123.html"" target=""_blank"">reported in Hindi-language media</a>.

The journalist, who also wrote for the <i>Nasza Mława</i> website, was followed into the club's bathroom and assaulted, according to news reports that cited details from CCTV footage.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Masiak reported on illegal drugs, environmental pollution from chicken farms, arbitrary arrests, and crime for <i>Nasza Mława</i>. He also reported on local mixed martial arts competitors, according to <a href=""http://www.fakt.pl/wydarzenia/dziennikarz-z-mlawy-zginal-bo-pisal-niewygodne-tematy,artykuly,552384.html"">local press reports</a>.</p>

They said a district court had issued a European arrest warrant on June 25, 2015.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Masiak had been assaulted and threatened before, moves he said were in retaliation for his journalism. In January 2014, Masiak was attacked in front of his apartment building, according to <a href=""https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2015/06/poland-journalist-lukasz-masiak-fatally-beaten/"">Index on Censorship</a>, the U.K.-based press freedom organization. Speaking to regional radio station <a href=""http://joemonster.org/link/pokaz/52271/Mlawa_dziennikarz_spryskany_gazem_i_pobity"">Polskie Radio</a> at the time, Masiak said he was sprayed with a gas, then kicked and beaten by a masked attacker who did not speak during the assault. In the radio interview Masiak said he did not believe it was a robbery because neither his camera nor his cell phone, which he had with him, were taken. According to a translated version of the interview, Masiak said: ""It was certainly about content published on [<i>Nasza Mława</i>.] I see no other possibility. I can guess which content and I have an idea who stood behind the attack, but I cannot reveal this. I leave that to the police.""</p>
<p></p>
<p>In December 2014, a fake obituary notice was delivered to the house of the journalist's mother, according to <a href=""https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2015/06/poland-journalist-lukasz-masiak-fatally-beaten/"">Index on Censorship</a> and local news reports.

No arrests have been made and investigators have not identified the person behind the threat, according to Index on Censorship.</p>

<p>A representative of the Nineveh Reporters Network told CPJ that al-Abadi worked for the group. He said that on June 4 Islamic State fighters kidnapped al-Abadi from his home in Mosul and seized his computer and phone.</p>
<p>According to the network and the journalists' syndicate, al-Abadi was accused of leaking information about Islamic State-occupied Mosul to the Iraqi media, a charge the Islamist group has levied against numerous other journalists it has kidnapped from the city. After the journalist was executed by firing squad, his family was asked to collect his remains from the city morgue, news <a href=""http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2015/Jul-18/307248-isis-executes-journalist-in-mosul.ashx?utm_source=Magnet&amp;utm_medium=Entity%20page&amp;utm_campaign=Magnet%20tools"">reports</a> said citing unnamed security and medical sources.</p>
<p>The Nineveh Reporters Network is made up of a group of local journalists who report anonymously on life under Islamic State rule in the city of Mosul. The network's contributors post stories and photographs on its <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ShabktA3lamiwNinawa"">Facebook page</a>. Most of the contributors are anonymous out of fear of reprisal by the Islamic State.</p>
<p>In June 2014, Islamic State militants swept into the city, routing Iraqi security forces and imposing authoritarian order on the city. Militants raided and shut down numerous news outlets, including Al-Mosuliya TV, etc. An unknown number of journalists were <a href=""/blog/2015/04/in-iraq-islamic-state-exacts-heavy-toll-on-journal.php"">abducted</a>, with reports conflicting as to whether they are alive or dead.</p>
<p>Before working for the Nineveh Reporters Network, al-Abadi worked for several local outlets, including Al-Mosuliya TV station. In May 2014, the month before Islamic State took over Mosul, Al-Mosuliya broadcast videos filmed by al-Abadi about Mosul residents preparing for the year's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wB_se9-hbA&amp;app=desktop"">harvest</a> and students studying for upcoming <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/jalaaalabady/posts/581579778606644"">exams</a>.</p>
<p>Murad Ghazi, deputy manager of Al-Mosuliya, told CPJ in 2013 that the channel often reported critically on the local government and had been targeted by a smear campaign that accused it of serving U.S. interests. Militant groups like Islamic State have historically <a href=""/killed/2008/sirwa-abdel-wahab.php"">targeted</a> journalists in Mosul whom it considers <a href=""/killed/2007/amer-malallah-al-rashidi.php"">collaborators</a> with the U.S.-backed Iraqi government, according to CPJ research.</p>

He worked for the local news agency <i>AVC Noticias</i>, the national newsweekly <i>Proceso</i>, and photo agency Cuartoscuro<i> </i>and often covered local activist causes, local journalists told CPJ.</p>
<p>Espinosa had been threatened repeatedly in the past few years. He told CPJ in June that he fled Veracruz after he noticed people outside his home in Xalapa three separate times who gave him intimidating glances and gestures. He said that in 2013, he was among the journalists <a href=""http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=353007"" target=""_blank"">attacked</a> by police during a September 2013 eviction of protesting teachers and students.

<p>Espinosa had <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/who-killed-ruben-espinosa-and-nadia-vera"">clashed</a> in previous years with authorities in Veracruz. He told the news website <i>Sin Embargo</i> that local authorities had been angered by a front-page photo he had taken of Veracruz Gov. Javier Duarte de Ochoa that was published in <i>Proceso</i> on February 15, 2014, under the headline ""Veracruz: Lawless State.""</p>
<p>Before fleeing to Mexico City, Espinosa was very active within a group of Veracruz journalists who called on state authorities to investigate crimes against murdered journalists, a Mexican journalist who spoke on condition of anonymity told CPJ. ""He became one of the leaders of the group and represented them in meeting with authorities,"" the journalist said.</p>
<p>On August 4, authorities in Mexico City arrested Daniel Pacheco Gutiérrez, who they said was a suspect in connection with the killing, prosecutor Rodolfo Rios Garza <a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/mexico-journalist-seeking-refuge-capital-never-felt-safe-040113739.html"">announced</a>.

<p>According to press reports, Pacheco said he had been in the apartment but that he hadn't participated in the murders. In a statement he gave to prosecutors, he said he had been invited by an individual named <span>José Abraham t</span>o meet a Colombian woman he knew in that neighborhood. On August 11, the national daily <em>Reforma</em> reported that Pacheco <a href=""http://www.animalpolitico.com/2015/08/el-hombre-detenido-por-el-multihomicidio-en-narvarte-identifica-a-supuestos-complices/"">had identified</a> two accomplices: Abraham, who Pacheco said was a former Mexico City police officer and guarded parked cars in the streets in exchange for money, and an individual known as Omar, who he said was a juggler who performed at traffic intersections.</p>
<p>Pacheco was accused of murder, femicide, and aggravated robbery. The other two men were fugitives.</p>
<p>When interrogated by a Mexican judge, Pacheco alleged he had been tortured and beaten, the local press <a href=""http://www.m-x.com.mx/2015-08-19/10-inconsistencias-de-la-pgjdf-en-el-caso-de-la-narvarte-por-karla-michel-salas-y-david-pena/"">reported</a>.

<p>Investigators said they had not disregarded any motive in the multiple homicide, including Espinosa's work. But local journalists and activists said that authorities were not looking into the photographer's work or the threats he had received. They also pointed out inconsistencies in the investigation: Investigators said the murders took place sometime between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., but Espinosa's final text messages, <a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/mexico-journalist-seeking-refuge-capital-never-felt-safe-040113739.html"">obtained</a> by The Associated Press, show that he was still alive at 2:13 p.m.</p>

<p>Carvalho was the director of the small station and presented a one-hour morning show and an afternoon show from noon to 3 p.m., in which he often criticized local police and politicians, Tadeu Nogeira, a friend and colleague who worked on a companion blog to Carvalho's show, told CPJ.</p>
<p>The journalist had received <a href=""http://g1.globo.com/ceara/noticia/2015/09/suspeitos-de-matar-radialista-no-ce-visitaram-radio-dias-antes-do-crime.html"">death threats</a> from anonymous sources that police said were in connection with his on-air reports on corruption and wrongdoing by local police and politicians in Camocim.</p>
<p>A police spokesman who asked not to be identified told CPJ the journalist's cellphone contained messages sent to family members saying he was afraid because of death threats made against him. Nogueira told CPJ similar threats had been left on his <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/omelhordoradio?ref=br_rs"">Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p>A day after the murder, police <a href=""http://pt.euronews.com/2015/08/09/brasil-policia-deteve-dois-suspeitos-do-homicidio-do-jornalista-gleydson/"">arrested</a> Gisele de Souza do Nascimento, 23, and Francisco Antonio Carneiro Portela, 18, in the nearby town of Senador Sá, the police spokesman told CPJ via phone. The suspects were accused of providing a safe house for the gunmen. Police said they found the clothes that were worn by the suspected shooters, as well as two revolvers and ammunition. The two are in custody and have been charged with murder, according to news reports.</p>
<p>Police also detained a third man in the neighboring town of Martinópole. Daniel Lennon Almada, 31, was accused of providing the killers with the getaway motorcycle, the police spokesman told CPJ. Lennon was identified as the nephew of João Batista Pereira da Silva, the uncle of the mayor of Martinópole. He is in custody and has been charged with murder.</p>
<p>The prosecutor's indictment also named the alleged gunmen as local residents<b> </b>Thiago Lemos da Silva, 22, and Israel Marques Carneiro.<b> </b>""[The gunmen] are on the run and we are searching for them,"" the police spokesman told CPJ</p>
<p>According to the indictment, the two killed Carvalho because he had criticized James Mel, the mayor of Martinópole town.</p>
<p>In September, police <a href=""http://g1.globo.com/goias/noticia/2015/09/jovem-nega-ter-atirado-em-radialista-mas-admite-participacao-no-crime.html"">arrested</a> Lemos and his wife, Regina Rocha Lopes, 19, who was <a href=""http://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,mp-do-ceara-denuncia-7-pessoas-por-morte-de-radialista,1751842"">accused of</a> collaborating in the planning of the crime, press reports said. According to police, Lemos admitted participating in the murder but denied shooting Carvalho.  </p>
<p>Police identified the mastermind of the crime as Silva, the mayor's uncle, according to the indictment. Souza do Nascimento said Silva agreed to pay 9,000 reals (about US$2,300) to the gunmen to commit crimes, including the murder, the police spokesman and <a href=""http://globaljournalist.org/2015/09/seven-charged-in-death-of-brazilian-radio-broadcaster/"" target=""_blank"">press reports</a> said. Silva remains at large. In December 2015, police arrested his brother, Francisco, who is accused of funding the crime, according to local <a href=""http://g1.globo.com/ceara/noticia/2015/12/policia-prende-suspeito-de-financiar-assassinato-de-radialista-no-ceara.html"">news reports</a>. </p>",,,,,2015,BR,BR,.br,Brazil,brazil,Americas,americas,americas,Brazil,Confirmed

<p>Neel was also an active member of the Ganajagaran Mancha, a group campaigning for the execution of those accused of committing war crimes during Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence.</p>
<p>In 2013, Neel's name appeared on a list widely circulated by Islamist groups in Bangladesh<b> </b>that called for the deaths of 84 bloggers perceived to be atheists, according to news accounts.</p>
<p>The BBC reported that Neel identified as a secular atheist and came from a Hindu background--similar to bloggers <a href=""/killed/2015/avijit-roy.php"">Roy</a> and <a href=""/killed/2015/ananta-bijoy-das.php"">Ananta Bijoy Das</a>, slain earlier in 2015.</p>

<p>Neel's wife, Asha Moni, said that a few months prior to his death, police at a nearby police station refused to accept a complaint Neel tried to file after he noticed he was being followed by strange men, according to reports, which also cited a review of Neel's Facebook posts. Police said they were unaware of any such request.</p>

Hugo Joven, the director of La Preferida Estero, told CPJ that Núñez had not told anyone at the station that she had been threatened.</p>
<p>On September 26, 2015, authorities arrested Juan Camilo Ortiz, who was the suspected gunman, in the nearby town of Los Palmiros, according to <a href=""http://www.eltiempo.com/politica/justicia/asesinato-de-la-periodista-flor-alba-nunez-las-pruebas-contra-el-sicario-de-la-reportera-del-huila/16388818"" target=""_blank"">news reports</a>. The Attorney General's Office charged him with murder the following day.</p>

<p>Investigators said the motorcycle suspected of being used as the getaway vehicle was found in the house of one of Ortiz's family members, <i>El Tiempo</i> reported.

<p>Villalba told CPJ that in August 2015 Núñez reported on how several men in Pitalito, who claimed to have been attacked by a bull terrier, <a href=""http://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/otras-ciudades/maltrato-animal-ahorcan-a-perro-bull-terrier-dominic-en-pitalito-huila/16256155"" target=""_blank"">hung</a> the dog from a lamppost.

The bombs that night killed at least nine people, including women and children, and injured <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzJuqa4kq7w"">several more</a>, the Reuters report said.</p>
<p>Sharaf al-Deen was the sixth journalist or media worker to be killed by Saudi-coalition bombings in three separate incidents in 2015, according to <a href=""/killed/mideast/yemen/"">CPJ research</a>. As of September 21, 2015, the Saudi embassy in Washington, D.C. failed to respond to multiple requests for comment via phone and email about journalists killed by coalition bombing.</p>
<p>Houthi rebels took control of the capital, Sana'a, and other cities in September 2014, eventually forcing the government to resign, according to news reports. On March 25, 2015, a Saudi Arabia-led coalition of 10 countries began <a href=""http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/04/15/yemen-factory-airstrike-killed-31-civilians"" target=""_blank"">launching</a> air strikes, targeting territory controlled by the Houthi militia, in an attempt to restore the exiled president who <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/26/us-yemen-security-idUSKBN0ML0YC20150326"" target=""_blank"">fled</a> Yemen later that month as the Houthis increased their<b> </b>control over the country. Around the time that the air strikes began, outlets critical of the Houthis or affiliated with coalition governments were<b> </b>raided by Houthi forces and their staff temporarily detained, according to CPJ <a href=""/2015/03/media-outlets-raided-and-banned-as-conflict-spiral.php"">research</a>.</p>
<p>Al-Ashmory told CPJ that Sharaf al-Deen began working for Al-Masirah TV in 2012. A <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJc350nYzVk"">video</a> broadcast by the station said he reported on the conflict from all over Yemen and that he had also worked as a producer.</p>
<p>Sharaf al-Deen had posted many pictures of himself on Facebook in which he was wielding guns and wearing military-style clothing; in some of the posts, he wrote that he stood guard at neighborhood checkpoints and that it was people's duty to defend their country against internal and external threats.</p>
<p>Al-Ashmory told CPJ Sharaf al-Deen was not a fighter and had posted the pictures to support the army. Another journalist, Assad al-Emad, editor-in-chief of the website <i>Yemen News Gate </i>who studied at Sana'a University with Sharaf al-Deen, told CPJ that Sharaf al-Deen did not participate in fighting and was a supporter of Houthi forces.</p>

SMART's general coordinator, Abdou al-Fadhel, told CPJ Ghazal died while covering the bombardment for the outlet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ghazal's brother, Ghaith, told CPJ that Ghazal was at his family's house when they heard the sound of barrel bombs exploding. Ghazal was killed after leaving the house to film the bombardment and to help the injured. Ghaith told CPJ his brother intended to send footage of the bombing to SMART but was killed before he could capture any footage.</p>
<p></p>
<p>SMART reported that Ghazal died from shrapnel wounds to the chest and shoulder. Some pro-opposition outlets published a graphic picture of Ghazal after he had died, with a deep gash in his right shoulder.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Three days before Ghazal's death Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, described <a href=""https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/09/23/stem-flow-syrian-refugees-stop-barrel-bombs"">barrel bombs</a> as ""Assad's most devastating weapon"" used against civilians. Since the start of the civil war,<b> </b>the Assad government has arbitrarily bombed civilian areas such as Taftanaz by rolling makeshift bombs filled with shrapnel and explosives out the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-IpY9Supag"">doors</a> of its fleet of helicopters. President Bashar al-Assad has <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31327152"">denied</a> indiscriminately bombing civilians with barrel bombs despite the overwhelming <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/syrian-regimes-barrel-bombs-kill-more-civilians-isis-al-qaeda-combined-2057392"">evidence</a> presented by human rights groups and international observers. <b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Local news reports <a href=""http://all4syria.info/Archive/254952"">said</a> at least five people were killed and more than two dozen were injured in the bombing of Taftanaz, and the pro-opposition Taftanaz Media Office published graphic footage of the wounded receiving treatment at a crowded clinic.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The day before Ghazal's death, government and opposition forces agreed to a wide-ranging ceasefire in Idlib province, including Taftanaz, in the wake of major rebel advances, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/world/middleeast/syria-rebels-reach-truce-with-assad.html?_r=1"">news reports</a> said. The most powerful rebel coalition fighting in Idlib, Jaish al-Fateh, responded to the bombardment of Taftanaz by shelling government-held towns nearby, according to reports. Despite the violent start, the ceasefire largely held in the weeks after Ghazal's death, reports said.<b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>SMART News Agency said Ghazal previously worked as a reporter for the Taftanaz Media Office and the media office for Ahrar al-Sham, a rebel groups belonging to the Jaish al-Fateh coalition. Several of Ahrar al-Sham's founders had ties to al-Qaeda and, at the time of Ghazal's death, the Jaish al-Fateh coalition included al-Qaeda's official branch in Syria, the Nusra Front. SMART's coordinator al-Fadhel said Ghazal joined the news agency in 2013 and was not working for any other organization besides SMART.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ghaith Ghazal confirmed his brother had been part of Ahrar al-Sham as a fighter and a member of one of its media centers, helping to publicize the group, but that he was no longer a member of Ahrar al-Sham when he began working for SMART.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ghazal regularly posted videos published by SMART on Facebook but because SMART does not usually use bylines for its videos, it was not clear which were filmed by him. Three weeks before his death, SMART published <a href=""https://smartnews-agency.com/index.php/ar/media/display?id=370"">photos</a> under Ghazal's byline of rubble left behind in Sarmin by what the agency said was government shelling in the Idlib province town.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ghaith Ghazal told CPJ that his 24-year-old brother was married and has a two-year old son and six-month old daughter. He left his studies at nursing school to join the protest movement at the start of the uprising against the Assad government in 2011, and was detained as a result for a month in 2012.</p>

The official Syrian government outlet SANA <a href=""http://www.sana.sy/?p=287804"">claimed</a> it was Syrian government jets that killed Aledel, whom SANA accused of being a ""terrorist.""</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Russian Defense Ministry did not respond to CPJ's emailed request for comment in late October 2015. When CPJ called the Russian embassy in Washington, D.C., a man who did not identify himself said the claim that a Russian airstrike had killed Aledel was false. When asked which part of the story was false, the man said he had no comment and hung up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Russian military has not publicly disclosed any specific strikes in or near Binin on October 23. On October 26, the Russian Defense Ministry <a href=""http://eng.syria.mil.ru/en/index/syria/news/more.htm?id=12061860@egNews"">said</a> on its website it had launched 164 combat sorties targeting 285 ""terrorist objects"" in the past three days across Syria, including in Idlib province.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Russian military said it began airstrikes in Syria in September 2015 against Islamic State, Al-Qaeda, and other militant groups. Russia has come under criticism by Syrian rebels and their supporters for using the strikes as an excuse to target all rebels fighting the Assad government, a long-time strategic ally of Russia. <a href=""http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/10/25/russia/syria-possibly-unlawful-russian-air-strikes"">Human rights</a> and <a href=""https://www.sams-usa.net/foundation/index.php/component/content/article/2-uncategorised/205-press-release-two-medical-staff-killed-in-russian-airstrikes-on-sarmin"">civil society groups</a> have <a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/nearly-450-killed-russian-strikes-syria-monitor-115401925.html"">criticized</a> the strikes for indiscriminately killing and even targeting civilians.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a report citing ""battlefield sources"" SANA claimed Aledel was one of 13 Ahrar al-Sham members killed by Syrian airstrikes near Binin. Ahrar al-Sham, whose fighters have links to Al-Qaeda, is a leading member of the Jaish al-Fateh coalition that includes Al-Qaeda's official branch in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra. At the time of Aledel's death, the coalition comprised one of the strongest fighting forces countering the Assad government and Islamic State.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Aledel's Twitter <a href=""https://twitter.com/abokazemm1"">page</a> featured a picture of many of Ahrar al-Sham's leaders who had been killed, and he <a href=""https://twitter.com/abokazemm1/status/656075554593091585"">memorialized</a> on social media leaders of other rebel groups who have died. CPJ did not find any evidence that Aledel participated in fighting. A month before his death, Aledel <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1640989346149080&amp;set=pb.100007140906557.-2207520000.1446145932.&amp;type=3&amp;theater"">posted</a> a picture of himself raising a camera in the air and said it was the weapon he chose to support the revolution.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.alaan.tv/news/world-news/141341/waseem-aladel-the-voice-of-freedom-in-the-face-of-tyrants"">news reports</a>, Aledel defected from the Syrian army at the start of the uprising and began working in media. He first worked in the media office for the opposition coalition group, Syrian Revolution General Commission, filming fighting and other stories from his hometown of Maarat al-Numan and other parts of Idlib province. He later worked a freelancer for local and international outlets, including <a href=""http://www.aljazeera.net/news/humanrights/2015/10/24/%D9%85%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%84-%D8%B5%D8%AD%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%BA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A5%D8%AF%D9%84%D8%A8"">Al-Jazeera</a> and Turkey's state-run outlet <a href=""http://www.aa.com.tr/en/world/syrian-journalist-killed-in-russian-airstrikes/454251"">Anadolu Agency</a>, who both reported his death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In August 2015, he helped found the Maarat Media Center, a collective of journalists from his hometown. According to the center, the group <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/maaramc12/photos/a.877157032378548.1073741828.873683836059201/877154022378849/?type=3"">reports</a> independently from Maarat al-Numan and its environs in an attempt to unify opposition forces in the fight against the Assad government. In the weeks before Aledel's death, the center focused its reporting on what it called the ""Russian aggression,"" filming what it said were civilian casualties caused by Russian airstrikes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On October 6, 2015 the group <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co9UgZ7IyTY"">published</a> a video of Aledel reporting on anti-Russian protests in Idlib and the silence of the international community. On October 12, 2015 Aledel was injured while covering fighting in Kfar Nabouda, north of the city of Hama. A <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/100009175843872/videos/1513864825596031/?fref=nf"">video</a> of Aledel slurring pro-opposition slogans under anesthetic as medical workers attended to a wound on his face went viral as numerous people wished him a fast recovery on social media.</p>

From minute 0.40 to 1.12, the footage shows a family escaping from a building surrounded by dust and rubble. Al-Ahmad tells the camera the mosque has been hit. At 1.35, as he interviews a man who says civilians have been targeted in the attacks, a third airstrike hits close by. Several minutes later a fourth bomb strikes and badly wounds al-Ahmad, al-Khatib said. The footage posted on YouTube does not show this explosion.</p>
<p>Al-Khatib told CPJ that al-Ahmad was rushed to the Turkish border for treatment, but had died by the time the director arrived about an hour later. Activists <a href=""http://all4syria.info/Archive/264506"">told the media</a> that two Syrian civil defense members and a number of civilians were injured in the attacks on Hayan that day.</p>

The violations center cited a Hayan-based media activist as saying the fourth airstrike on October 27, allegedly launched by Russia, struck a house in the town. Al-Ahmad, who was standing about 10 meters from the house at the time, was injured, the center said.</p>
<p>The Russian military began airstrikes on Syria in September 2015, ostensibly targeting Islamic State, Al-Qaeda and other militant groups. Russia has come under criticism from the Syrian opposition and their supporters for allegedly using the strikes to target all rebels fighting the government of Bashar al-Assad, a long-time strategic ally of Russia. <a href=""https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/10/25/russia/syria-possibly-unlawful-russian-air-strikes"">Human rights</a> and <a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/nearly-450-killed-russian-strikes-syria-monitor-115401925.html"">civil society groups</a> have criticized the strikes for indiscriminately targeting civilians.</p>
<p>The Russian Defense Ministry has not not responded to CPJ's emailed request for comment.

Hayan was not specifically mentioned.</p>
<p>Syrian state news agency <a href=""http://sana.sy/?p=289577"">SANA said</a> government warplanes also hit Hayan on October 27, targeting ""terrorist organizations."" The report said the ""terrorists"" the airstrikes targeted named al-Ahmad as being among those killed. CPJ is unable to confirm whether Russian or Syrian airstrikes targeted Hayan on the day al-Ahmad died.</p>
<p>On its website, Shahba Press Agency <a href=""http://goo.gl/xk6t1W"">commemorated</a> al-Ahmad's commitment to documenting the war.

<p><a href=""http://hrcp-web.org/hrcpweb/hrcp-monitor-murdered-in-targeted-attack-in-tank/"">In a statement</a>, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan called on authorities to catch the killers and bring them to justice. The statement added: ""In none of the five previous fatal casualties that [the commission] has suffered over the last few years have the authorities succeeded in catching the killers."" In an email, Zohra Yousuf, the commission's chairperson, told CPJ that members of the commission who knew Mehsud had met to discuss his case. ""The consensus is that he was killed because of his work as a journalist,"" Yousuf said.</p>
<p>The Taliban claimed responsibility for Mehsud's killing, with its commander Qari Saif Ullah Saif telling Reuters: ""We killed him because he was writing against us ... we have some other journalists on our hit list in the region, soon we will target them."" It is difficult to verify such claims independently, but it follows a pattern of attacks on journalists and human rights workers in and around the Federally Administered Tribal Areas.</p>
<p>Mehsud reported mainly from South Waziristan in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas, along the border with Afghanistan. Violence including targeted killings in the Tank district, which borders South Waziristan, is commonplace, according to reports.

Mohamed Saleh, a member of the pro-opposition Hama Media Center, confirmed Abu al-Hamza was filming for SMART, adding that he also worked for the media center.</p>

<p>In a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNI3PvQYIFc"">graphic video</a> posted by Abu Arab to his YouTube page the following day, the same Ajnad al-Sham fighter is seen speaking to Abu al-Hamza about the offense as the faint sound of a mortar firing can be heard in the distance. As the fighter looks up, a mortar shell hits in front of the camera. The camera was propelled to the ground by the blast but continued to record the sound of those who had been injured.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The journalist's colleagues told CPJ Abu al-Hamza and the Ajnad al-Sham fighter were killed. Saleh, Abu Arab, and Abu Farouk were injured in the explosion and an Ajnad al-Sham fighter needed his hand amputated, Saleh said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The SMART News correspondent Hoeesh told CPJ that Abu al-Hamza joined the agency two months earlier and was still in his probationary period when he died.</p>

<p>During his probationary period with SMART, Abu al-Hamza posted numerous SMART videos to his Facebook page, which he claimed to have filmed in the Hama countryside and which showed <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1506492496336836&amp;id=100009283018949"">opposition</a> forces <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1509936299325789&amp;id=100009283018949"">fighting</a> or <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/100009283018949/videos/1494816610837758/"">government</a> aircraft <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdlE2mfNCvs"">bombing</a>. SMART News Agency typically does not add bylines to its videos. In the week before his death, the agency published several photos under his byline of opposition forces <a href=""https://smartnews-agency.com/index.php/ar/album/188%5C/%D9%81%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%84-%D8%B9%D8%B3%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%B2-%D8%AA%D9%84-%D8%B9%D8%AB%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%A9#6"">shelling</a> government positions and <a href=""https://smartnews-agency.com/index.php/ar/media/1517/%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B3%D9%87%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%A8%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%A9"">ruins</a> in the wake of government bombing.</p>

<p>Both Saleh and Hoeesh told CPJ Abu al-Hamza also worked for the media office of a local branch of Ahrar al-Sham, another rebel group belonging to the Jaish al-Fateh coalition. Several of Ahrar al-Sham's founders had ties to al-Qaeda and, at the time of Abu al-Hamza's death, the Jaish al-Fateh coalition included al-Qaeda's official branch in Syria, the Nusra Front.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Saleh, who also was a member of the Ahrar al-Sham's local media office until he quit after Abu al-Hamza's death, said that Abu al-Hamza joined the group as a fighter but became involved only in media work nearly two years ago. Saleh explained how a crew from the media office would join fighters on the battlefield, each of them focusing on filming different kinds of weaponry to get the full picture of the battle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Abu al-Hamza's Facebook shows his apparent support for Ahrar al-Sham, with his <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009283018949"">banner picture</a> featuring the group's logo and frequent posts about the group's <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1464226107230142&amp;set=a.1435274836791936.1073741827.100009283018949&amp;type=3"">fighters</a> and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/100009283018949/videos/1494932870826132/"">leaders</a> who had been <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1491320507854035&amp;set=a.1435274836791936.1073741827.100009283018949&amp;type=3&amp;permPage=1"">killed</a>. In what appear to be posts related to his role as part of the group's media office, he shared pictures and messages of support for fighters. In May 2015, he posted a picture of what he said were two Ahrar al-Sham fighters detaining a ""supporter of the Assad gangs."" A few days later, he posted a picture purportedly distributed by Islamic State of the heads of beheaded opposition fighters in a truck bed. Two weeks later, in an apparent response, he posted pictures of rebels, including one he said was a member of Ahrar al-Sham, holding the heads of beheaded Islamic State fighters.</p>

<p>The radio reporter was in an electronics store after taking his two children to school, when a man opened fire and hit Silva at least twice, once in the arm and once in the neck, reports said. Silva's belongings were not taken in the attack, and the assailant fled on an accomplice's motorbike, according to reports that cited witnesses.</p>
<p>Silva hosted the daily show ""Open Microphone"" on the town's community station Rádio Itaenga FM. The show, which ran from noon to 1pm, took calls from listeners about alleged corruption and malfeasance by politicians and police, his colleague and friend Edilson Gomes dos Santos told CPJ in a telephone call from the station. Silva also interviewed mayors, city councilmen, and state deputies about contentious local issues, Gomes dos Santos said.</p>
<p>Silva, who had worked at the station for five years and was also employed as a municipal guard, would often call out authorities for alleged misdeeds. His outspoken demands for justice brought him several death threats, Gomes dos Santos said.</p>
<p>""He always butted heads with authorities and people would come up to him on the street and tell him he was going to die or that he better be careful because his life was in danger,"" Gomes dos Santos, who hosts two daily shows on Rádio Itaenga FM, told CPJ.

<p>Two friends and an acquaintance of Diniz, with whom CPJ spoke, said the blogger worked as a press officer for Marcel Curió, the mayor of Governador Nunes Freire, and blogged about scandals and alleged wrongdoing by other local politicians.

<p>Friends of Diniz told CPJ the blogger had received death threats previously, including in the week of his death.

Al-Hamza denied any of the hostages worked with RBSS. Western intelligence agencies are investigating the authenticity of the video, according to <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35219059"">news reports</a>.</p>
<p>The Nusra Front,<b> </b>an al-Qaeda affiliate that controls Idlib, told al-Hamza it is investigating al-Mousa's death.</p>
<p>According to al-Hamza, al-Mousa edited and vetted reports for RBSS from Raqqa out of Gaziantep in Turkey and Idlib in Syria. He went into hiding in Idlib several months before his death, after Islamic State kidnapped his father and released a <a href=""/blog/2015/07/how-islamic-state-uses-killings-to-try-to-spread-f.php"">video of his murder</a> in August 2015. One week after al-Mousa's murder, Islamic State claimed to have <a href=""https://twitter.com/Raqqa_SL/status/679280010042195969"" target=""_blank"">killed</a> the journalist's aunt, Maria Hasan al-Shams, al-Hamza said. She was <a href=""https://twitter.com/Raqqa_SL/status/679280010042195969"" target=""_blank"">taken captive</a> in October after militants found a picture on her phone of Hamoud al-Mousa, who is the brother of the dead journalist and one of RBSS's co-founders, al-Hamza told CPJ.</p>
<p>Since April 2014, RBSS has documented the abuses of Islamic State in Raqqa. RBSS, which has been declared an ""enemy of God"" by the militants, also reports critically on the Assad government's bombings, other rebel forces, and civilian casualties caused by airstrikes.</p>

<p><span>Bahir al-Sharabi, a Yemeni journalist working for the Yemen Digital Media production company, told CPJ he traveled with Mojalli on the morning of January 17 along with a driver and a local resident to cover the effects of recent Saudi-led airstrikes in the Hamam Jarif area, about 25 miles south of the capital, Sanaa. According to<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><i>The New York Times</i>, at least 15 civilians had been<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/18/world/middleeast/covering-war-at-home-costs-a-yemeni-his-life.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank""><span>killed</span></a><span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span>in airstrikes there the previous week.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Al-Sharabi told CPJ that they arrived to the scene around 9 a.m. After about 15 or 20 minutes, they were unexpectedly caught in a Saudi-led coalition airstrike. An explosion knocked Al-Sharabi unconscious. When he came to his senses, Al-Sharabi said, he found Mojalli seriously injured nearby. Al-Sharabi and others, many of them injured themselves, loaded their colleague into the car and tried to find medical assistance, but Mojalli died before they could find help.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Al-Sharabi, who suffered light injuries, told CPJ he did not think he and Mojalli were directly targeted by the Saudi coalition airstrikes, and he was not sure if there were any military targets in the area when the airstrike hit. He said their car was not marked as a press vehicle, and nothing on their clothing identified them as press.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Mohammed al-Asaadi, a communications specialist with UNICEF, told CPJ Mojalli had been scheduled to interview a UNICEF official that afternoon about the impact of the conflict on the education system in the country. Al-Asaadi said Mojalli's work ""informed the world about the forgotten people"" in Yemen, adding he worked as a fixer for a UNICEF film about marginalized communities in the country. Al-Asaadi, who is also the former editor-in-chief of the English-language <i>Yemen Observer</i>, also said Mojalli had previously worked for the newspaper. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>At the time of Mojalli's death, at least four other journalists had been killed in airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition since its military campaign against Ansar Allah, also known as the Houthis, and their allies began in the spring of 2015, according to<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><a href=""/killed/mideast/yemen/""><span>CPJ research</span></a>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

""He was often in fear,"" Sanmartín said. He told CPJ Hernández had been working on sensitive stories and was afraid of reprisal.</p>
<p>Hernández, 38, was also a freelance correspondent at La Ke Buena radio in the municipality of Pinotepa Nacional, and at a community station in Santiago Jamiltepec, according to local <a href=""http://www.animalpolitico.com/2016/01/asesinan-a-periodista-en-oaxaca-la-cuarta-entidad-con-mas-homicidios-de-comunicadores-en-mexico/"">news reports</a> and a colleague at the paper, who spoke with CPJ.

Turkish forces fired on those trying to help the wounded, according to Bulut and news reports. CPJ was not able to verify this claim as journalists were barred from the area.</p>
<p>Aktaş took refuge in a basement, where he became trapped with dozens of others, Bulut said. ""He called his family two days after he was shot and said he was wounded in the left arm,"" Bulut told CPJ.</p>

<p>Cirze is one of several areas in Turkey's southeast where security forces, backed by tanks, fought militants linked to the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK.

    	    <p>According to the news reports, al-Majidi joined a group of journalists on the front lines in the Dhabab area of western Taiz, when Houthi and pro-Saleh forces fired on them with small arms. Al-Majidi was struck in the head and died instantly. Another four journalists were also injured, the reports said.</p>
<p>A graphic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvK84NKlUCo"">video</a> published by Yemen TV shows a chaotic scene as journalists and gunmen alike run down a long, empty road, fleeing bullets fired by unseen gunmen. The video then cuts to al-Majidi's body in the morgue, blood staining his striped polo shirt as other journalists mourn.</p>
<p>Al-Majidi began working as an activist and photojournalist at the start of the 2011 protest movement to oust former president Saleh, according to the reports. According to the independent <i><a href=""http://almasdaronline.info/article/80562"">Al-Masdar news website</a></i>, al-Majidi worked under the pseudonym Mohammed al-Yemeni, refusing to reveal his real name and never publishing a picture of himself working.</p>
<p>He primarily published his photographs on his <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/taezialsharabi"">personal Facebook page</a> under the Mohammed al-Yemeni pseudonym. His older posts primarily focused on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=406118439471119&amp;set=a.406111752805121.96008.100002189006176&amp;type=3&amp;theater"">political protests</a> and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=514991975250431&amp;set=pb.100002189006176.-2207520000.1477579830.&amp;type=3&amp;theater"">social events</a>.

<p>Al-Majidi made clear in his reporting his support for the forces fighting the Houthi-Saleh rebels. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ku8S_qDI_Y"">News reports</a> said that in recognition of his support, a military leader, Hamoud Saeed al-Mekhlafi, entrusted him to become his personal photographer.</p>

Al-Qurashi says al-Majidi was killed moments later.</p>
<p>Al-Mekhlafi's office did not respond to CPJ's written requests for comment in October 2016 to confirm his relationship with al-Majidi.</p>
<p>Only two weeks before his death, al-Majidi was shot in his right leg while reporting. He posted on his <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/taezialsharabi/posts/972276609521963"">Facebook page</a> that it was not a serious injury, as ""the bullet entered and exited from the muscle.""</p>
<p>His injury and the repeated coverage of the violence in Taiz seemed to wear on al-Majidi. On March 18, he <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/taezialsharabi/posts/978666165549674"">confessed</a> on Facebook, ""The truth is I'm tired, and I can no longer continue for need of an open-ended vacation."" Yet he did not stop working. On the day he was killed, his <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/taezialsharabi/posts/978666165549674"">final post</a> reads, ""We're going out to the battle again.

He also sold content to local and international networks on a freelance basis.</p>
<p>Al-Zintani was covering an offensive by the Saiqa against Islamist militias at the time of his death, according to his colleagues and <a href=""https://www.libyaherald.com/2016/06/24/benghazi-photo-journalist-killed-by-gwarsha-sniper-as-fighting-continues/"">news reports</a>. The Saiqa's media office <a href=""http://www.almjharlibya.com/news_details2663.html"">released a statement</a> announcing the death of seven of its members on June 24, including al-Zintani, who was described as a media professional. Some of the work produced by the photographer, who had an unarmed role in the forces, was used internally by the Saiqa and some was used to promote the group on local channels, according to colleagues of al-Zintani.</p>
<p>After he was hit, al-Zintani was taken to a hospital in Benghazi, where he died later that day from his injuries, Omar Altwati, a freelance producer with whom al-Zintani had worked in the week before his death, told CPJ. According to Altwati and local news reports, the sniper likely belonged to the Islamist militias fighting for territory in and around Benghazi. CPJ was unable to determine if any group took responsibility.</p>
<p>The journalist had worked for multiple Libyan outlets, including al-Zintan TV, which released a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/alzintantv/photos/pb.307641219404149.-2207520000.1467216127./592318684269733/?type=3&amp;theater"">statement</a> paying tribute to him after his death. In the weeks before his death, he had worked closely with Altwati, a freelancer who produces video and images for Sky News Arabia TV, which is part-owned by British Sky Broadcasting and has headquarters in Abu Dhabi. A spokesperson for Sky News Arabia TV told CPJ that it did not deal directly with al-Zintani. </p>
<p>Altwati, the producer, told CPJ that al-Zintani had provided him with images of fighting in Gwersha earlier in June and that they communicated on June 23, the day before al-Zintani was killed. Records of text messages between the two journalists, viewed by CPJ, show that al-Zintani said on June 23 that he would cover any fighting for Altwati in the area in the coming days.</p>
<p>Altwati said he did not hear from al-Zintani again and when he tried to call him on June 24, the photographer's phone was turned off. Altwati said that another journalist told him al-Zintani had been killed covering a Libyan National Army offensive that day. Altwati told CPJ that he confirmed the death with a military spokesperson, who also said al-Zintani was with a Saiqa unit at the time he was hit.</p>
<p>A YouTube channel in al-Zintani's name <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/khalidmmsalim/videos"">contains videos</a> dating back to 2012, mostly about the fighting in Libya. Videos from the past three months before his death include a report about <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bQKUDoxsoc"">the Libyan National Army reclaiming</a> a cement factory in Benghazi from Islamist militias, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8So4NZhgNrw"">promotional reports</a> about the Libyan National Army's air force. The videos are marked as filmed and produced by al-Zintani.</p>
<p>Al-Zintani took up photojournalism in 2011 after the Libyan uprising against Muammar Qaddafi. Brian Conley, director of the U.S.-based company <a href=""http://smallworldnews.tv/"">Small World News</a>, which provides training to citizen journalists, told CPJ he met al-Zintani in Libya in 2011 when the journalist <a href=""http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/after-libya-s-elections-transitional-justice-balance"">was covering fighting</a> in the town of Zintan. He said that they met again in 2012 at a video production workshop that Conley ran in Benghazi. Conley said he helped al-Zintani sell content to U.S. television networks. The two later discussed collaborating on running workshops for young journalists in Libya, but the project never materialized, Conley said.</p>

    	    <p>The Islamic State group released a 15-minute video on June 25, 2016, showing the murder of five Syrians accused of working with media and nongovernmental organizations in Deir al-Zour, Syria. The 15-minute video, entitled ""Inspiration of Satan,"" is marked as having been produced by the local media branch of the Islamic State group in Deir al-Zour. The video, which CPJ reviewed, shows the five men confessing, apparently under duress, to collaborating with various media outlets and nongovernmental organizations. The men also perform re-enactments of their alleged reporting.</p>
<p>Eissa, 41, was abducted on October 2, 2015, after refusing to pledge allegiance to the group, his brother Yasser told CPJ. Yasser told CPJ they both worked for a local news website, Nateq Network, reporting on events in Deir al-Zour and its environs. Yasser left the province shortly before the Islamic State group took control in 2014, but Mohammed remained behind. According to <i>News Deeply</i>, the group forced all journalists to <a href=""https://www.newsdeeply.com/syria/articles/2014/10/07/isis-issues-11-rules-for-journalists-in-deir-ezzor/"">pledge allegiance</a> and agree to restrictions on their continued work as journalists.</p>
<p>Other victims in the video were abducted in early October 2015, according to their families and colleagues. Abu Abdul Rahman, a producer for Free Deir al-Zour Radio, which is opposed to the Syrian government and the Islamic State group, told CPJ that a senior Egyptian figure in Islamic State arrived in Deir al-Zour in October 2015 and tightened restrictions on the press.</p>
<p>Eissa says in the video that he had worked for Nateq Network before the Islamic State group entered the city, and that he had sent information to his brother for publication on Al-Jazeera's website in exchange for money. A militant from the Islamic State group then slits Eissa's throat while the journalist is handcuffed to a chair.</p>
<p>Yasser, who frequently contributes to Al-Jazeera, told CPJ that the allegation Eissa sent information to Al-Jazeera is false. He said he believed his brother had been ""intensely tortured"" to make a false confession. He added that he was not sure exactly when his brother was killed, but he said sources close to the group had informed him two months prior to the video's release that Eissa had been executed.</p>
<p>A spokesman from Al-Jazeera told CPJ that the video was not relevant to the network.</p>

<p>Aboud was a producer and reporter for <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/FREEDIERAZOURRADIO/"">Free Deir al-Zour Radio</a>, a radio station opposed to the Syrian government and to the Islamic State group. He had begun working as a journalist in 2011 and had taken up a formal role with Free Deir al-Zour Radio at the beginning of 2012, Abu Abdul Rahman, a producer at the channel, told CPJ. Aboud, who was also known as Abu Jafaar, reported on politics in Deir al-Zour until militants from the Islamic State group overran most of the province in mid-2014. Under the rule of the Islamic State group, Aboud shifted the focus of his reporting to social issues, such as the impact of the war on food prices, and did not directly criticize the Islamic State group, Abu Abdul Rahman said.</p>
<p>Aboud's colleagues believe he was abducted in early October 2015, shortly after a senior Egyptian figure from the Islamic State group arrived in the city and imposed tighter restrictions on journalists, Abu Abdul Rahman told CPJ.</p>

<p>In the video, Aboud confesses -- apparently under duress -- to working for the <i><a href=""http://din-sy.net/"">Development Interaction Network</a></i>, a news website. Aboud says he reported on the impact of the war on Deir al-Zour, including on the fluctuation of food prices and on the local police, as well as battlefield developments. A militant from the Islamic State group then stabs Aboud in the neck with a knife in the middle of a street.</p>
<p>The <i>Development Interaction Network</i> has not published any articles or post posts to their social media channels since October 2015, when Aboud is believed to have been kidnapped. CPJ has not been able to reach the outlet for comment.</p>
<p>Abu Abdul Rahman confirmed to CPJ that Aboud was a contributor to the website in addition to his work for Free Deir al-Zour Radio. The radio station has effectively gone underground since the new media regulations and the kidnap of Aboud, Abu Abdul Rahman said.

The 15-minute video, entitled ""Inspiration of Satan,"" is marked has having been produced by the local media branch of the Islamic State group in Deir al-Zour. The video, which CPJ reviewed, shows the five men confessing, apparently under duress, to collaborating with various media outlets and nongovernmental organizations. The men also perform re-enactments of their alleged reporting.</p>
<p>Rabah, who was professionally known as Abu Islam, had worked for the <a href=""http://www.syriahr.com/en/"">SOHR</a> since 2011, the year the Syrian uprising began, contributing stories and images to the monitoring group, its director, Rami Abdul Rahman, told CPJ in a phone interview.</p>
<p>Islamic State group militants abducted Rabah on October 4, 2015, from Deir al-Zour, other SOHR contributors in the area told Abdul Rahman. His capture came five days after Rabah received a phone call from an unknown caller in Turkey who demanded he share information about the activity of the Islamic State group in Deir al Zour and his exact location. Although Rabah did not give the caller any information, he told Abdul Rahman that he felt he was being monitored by the militants and that their conversation had been recorded. At the time, the Islamic State group controlled around half of Deir al-Zour province.</p>
<p>Other victims in the video were also abducted in early October 2015, according to their families and colleagues. Abu Abdul Rahman, a producer for Free Deir al-Zour Radio, which is opposed to the Syrian government and the Islamic State group, told CPJ that a senior Egyptian figure in the Islamic State group arrived in Deir al-Zour in October 2015 and implemented tighter restrictions on journalists.</p>
<p>The exact date of Rabah's death is unclear. In December 2015, two months after his abduction, several Syrian opposition news <a href=""http://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/54988"">websites</a> reported that four journalists had been executed by the militant group in Deir al-Zour. Some of these reports cited causes of death different than those apparently shown in the video.</p>
<p>In the video, Rabah says he is a 28-year-old independent journalist who had documented civilian life under the Islamic State group's rule in Deir al-Zour, and that he had passed information about the group to colleagues outside Syria. Rabah is then apparently killed when an explosive device attached to his computer is detonated.</p>
<p>Rabah does not say he worked for SOHR in the video, but the monitoring body issued a <a href=""http://www.syriahr.com/%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%B8%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7/"">statement</a> on June 26, saying Rabah had been employed by them. Abdul Rahman, who is based in London, told CPJ he is concerned about the safety of the outlet's remaining contributors in Deir al-Zour. They continue to provide information to the news desk, but Abdul Rahman warned them against shooting video and taking photographs. Abdul Rahman said he believes the video to be authentic.</p>
<p>Abdul Rahman told CPJ that he didn't know when Rabah had been killed. A cousin of Rabah's said the family had heard ""rumors"" in January that the journalist had been killed, but continued to hope he still was alive until video was released in June.

Two journalists for the state-run Al-Iraqiya television station, correspondent Ali Jawad and producer Ali Muftin, were also <a href=""http://www.alghadeer.tv/news/detail/42643/"">injured</a> in the incident, according to Al-Ghadeer TV, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxbDlB7OCIo"">Al-Iraqiya</a>, and <a href=""https://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2016/Jul-13/361865-attack-kills-iraqi-journalist-wounds-two.ashx"">Agence France-Presse</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omnXaBJxjsU"">commemorative documentary</a> by Al-Ghadeer TV, Jawad and Muftin said the three journalists were accompanying pro-government forces attempting to recapture the Islamic State-controlled <a href=""http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en&amp;lat=35.700174&amp;lon=43.286819&amp;z=14&amp;m=b&amp;show=/32986777/Ijahala&amp;search=Ijahala"">Qayyarah area</a> south of Mosul. They said that Islamic State militants suddenly attacked the convoy with chlorine explosives. CPJ could not independently confirm the claim, although the Islamic State group has attacked with chlorine <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/islamic-state-militants-allegedly-used-chlorine-gas-against-iraqi-security-forces/2014/10/23/c865c943-1c93-4ac0-a7ed-033218f15cbb_story.html"">previously</a>, according to news reports citing doctors and Iraqi officials.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The troops and journalists pushed to higher ground to avoid the chemical clouds from the chlorine attack but then began to receive heavy fire, the journalists said in the documentary. Mahmud and Muftin took cover behind armored Humvees but continued to receive direct fire.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omnXaBJxjsU&amp;t=34m50s"">Footage</a> from the documentary shows Mahmud filming without protective gear under heavy fire between two armored vehicles. Mahmud ducks behind the vehicle in front as a bullet strikes the windshield of the vehicle behind.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Muftin and Mahmud were far behind Jawad's position and without the ability to move forward. Jawad said that as he arrived with a Humvee to retrieve the other two journalists, a heat-seeking missile detonated nearby, resulting in Mahmud's death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>According to the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4vnZTdcxJk"">Al-Hurra</a> television station, Jawad suffered broken bones and shrapnel wounds and Muftin suffered less severe injuries due to the explosion. According to Al-Iraqiya <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se_aivHrvHk"">footage</a>, the severely wounded journalist, Jawad, recovered and was once again reporting less than three months after sustaining his injuries.</p>

<p>Muhannad al-Aqabi, the head of the media office for pro-government paramilitary forces, <a href=""https://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2016/Jul-13/361865-attack-kills-iraqi-journalist-wounds-two.ashx"">confirmed</a> that a heat-seeking missile killed Al-Ghadeer TV's Mahmud and injured Al-Iraqiya's Jawad and Muftin, according to Agence France-Presse. Al-Ghadeer TV is closely affiliated with the Badr Organization, a Shia political party and paramilitary force fighting alongside the Iraqi government.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Footage in the Al-Ghadeer TV documentary shows Mahmud pointing out enemy fighters seen through his zoomed camera lens to the pro-government forces with which he was embedded. There were also several photographs of Mahmud in fatigues and body armor carrying rifles and his camera simultaneously.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ali Muftin told CPJ that Mahmud was killed while on assignment with Al-Ghadeer TV, and confirmed that the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omnXaBJxjsU&amp;t=34m50s"">specific combat footage</a> from that commemorative documentary was from the day of Mahmud's death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Muftin told CPJ that Mahmud would point out enemy fighters to the pro-government forces with which he was embedded, including at night with his night-vision camera capabilities. He said that Mahmud only carried a weapon for self-defense, that the photos in the documentary were posed, and that Mahmud never fired a shot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Muftin praised Mahmud's journalistic courage, saying he covered Islamic State car bombs, even as they barreled toward the journalist. Mahmud was in his late twenties, married, and had one young daughter, Muftin said.</p>
<p>The battle for Qayyarah in which Mahmud was killed was part of operations in preparation for the campaign to retake the city of Mosul, the Islamic State group's stronghold in Iraq. Three months after Mahmud's death in Qayyarah, the Iraqi government formally <a href=""http://bigstory.ap.org/article/72cae3d2581748bd8f3150ac41023a99/iraqi-pm-signals-start-operations-drive-mosul"">commenced</a> the military campaign to retake Mosul, according to The Associated Press.</p>",,,,,2016,IZ,IQ,.iq,Iraq,iraq,Middle East,mideast,mideast,Iraq,Confirmed

<p>On July 27, police arrested Douglas Ferreira de Morais, 40, on suspicion that he had participated in the murder. Ferreira de Morais, the head of a group of security guards who work public sites in the city, was seen by witnesses driving the car used in the killing, according Fernando Gama, an investigator in the case, who spoke to the <a href=""http://g1.globo.com/goias/noticia/2016/07/servidor-publico-e-preso-suspeito-de-elo-com-morte-de-jornalista-em-go.html"">news website <i>G1</i></a>. Gama told <i>G1</i> that de Morais can be jailed for up to 30 days pending investigation.</p>
<p>Gama told CPJ on August 10 that police were still pursuing the person responsible for planning the murder, and that a motive had not yet been established. He said that de Morais was connected to a drug trafficker who had threated do Carmo over articles that the journalist had written.</p>",,,,,2016,BR,BR,.br,Brazil,brazil,Americas,americas,americas,Brazil,Confirmed

<p>While photographing the front line, Oerlemans was shot in the chest several times by an Islamic State sniper, according to <a href=""http://www.knack.be/nieuws/wereld/in-memoriam-jeroen-oerlemans-1970-2016/article-longread-760431.html"">an account published in <i>Knack </i>by de Rijke</a> and <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/03/world/middleeast/libya-jeroen-oerlemans-photojournalist.html"">news reports</a> that quoted Libyan hospital and government officials. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>In her account in <i>Knack</i>, de Rijke said that in the hours before he was killed, she and Oerlemans were following a group of Salafist fighters who were fighting Islamic State. The journalists followed the fighters to a square. Islamic State fighters had made a base in a building a few hundred feet away, and its snipers were shooting into the street. Oerlemans ran across the street with some fighters to photograph the front line, ducking the sniper fire. De Rijke stayed behind. About 10 minutes later she was notified by a phone call from a Libyan contact that he had been hit, at which point she raced to the Misrata field hospital where she learned that Oerlemans had been shot dead. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Oerlemans was shot while running alone across the street, according to de Rijke's account. The shooting seemed to come from snipers in the building where Islamic State fighters had a base. At least 18 other people were killed in the fighting in Sirte that day, 10 from the Islamic State side and eight from militants fighting against them, according to <a href=""http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/afp/2016/10/libya-conflict-netherlands-journalist.html"">news reports quoting</a> government officials. <o:p></o:p></p>

    	    <p>Al-Jisr on October 31 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUrMN4aqKqM"">published</a> a graphic video to its YouTube channel purportedly showing the moment Kanaan's body was recovered. The video shows medics rushing to a destroyed building and removing what appears to be Kanaan's corpse out of the rubble to a nearby vehicle. The videographer can be heard calling Kanaan's first name.</p>
<p>Al-Jisr's Homs correspondent, Anas Abu Adnan, who worked with Kanaan in reporting on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=333458797013755&amp;id=100010489125100&amp;match=2LnYqNivINin2YTYs9mE2KfZhSDZg9mG2LnYp9mG"">the area for years,</a> was present at the time of the air strike and survived. He <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YHvbTxJM5g"">told the station</a> that Kanaan filmed Syrian military planes firing missiles at the village from his home. A second strike directly hit his home and destroyed it. Kanaan was hit in the back of the head by shrapnel and died instantly, but several members of his family and neighbors were injured, Abu Adnan said.</p>
<p>Kanaan was an <a href=""http://www.skeyesmedia.org/ar/News/Syria/6095"">activist</a> and a fighter with the Syrian opposition before he started working for Al-Jisr TV in April 2014, the station <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJxU4-q3V3A"">said</a> in a YouTube video commemorating the journalist. He was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJxU4-q3V3A"">arrested</a> in 2007 and spent three years in jail for writing poetry opposing former Syrian president Hafiz Al-Assad, who in 1982 killed thousands of people putting down a Muslim Brotherhood rebellion in the nearby town of Hama. Kanaan joined mass protests against the Syrian government in 2011 and, after the government used lethal force in an attempt to quell the uprising, joined the armed opposition in 2012, Al-Jisr reported.</p>
<p>Following Kanaan's death, his brother, Mohamed, published a photograph of the journalist <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1848265425406632&amp;set=a.1389796917920154.1073741825.100006695769764&amp;type=3"">posing with a gun</a> on his personal Facebook page. A friend also used the photograph of Kanaan posing with a gun in <a href=""https://youtu.be/IbYloULYRZA?t=3m31s"">a video obituary published on YouTube</a> on November 2. Abu Adnan told the Committee to Protect Journalists that Kanaan had stopped fighting, and that over the course of the two years Kanaan had worked with Al-Jisr TV, Abu Adnan had never seen him carry a gun.</p>
